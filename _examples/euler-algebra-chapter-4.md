### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section IV. "Of Algebraic Equations, and the Resolution of Them." Chapter 4. "Of the Resolution of two or more Equations of the First Degree."

> **605.** It frequently happens that we are obliged to introduce into algebraic calculations
> two or more unknown quantities, represented by the letters $$x$$, $$y$$, $$z$$: and if the question
> is determinate, we are brought to the same number of equations as there are unknown quantities;
> from which it is then required to deduce those quantities. As we consider, at present, those
> equations only, which contain no powers of an unknown quantity higher than the first, and no
> products of two or more unknown quantities, it is evident that all those equations have the form
>
> $$az+by+cx=d$$.
>
> **606.** Beginning therefore with two equations, we shall
> endeavour to find from them the value of $$x$$ and $$y$$: and, in
> order that we may consider this case in a general manner, let
> the two equations be,
>
> $$ax + by = c$$; and $$fx + gy = h$$;
>
> in which, $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, and $$f$$, $$g$$, $$h$$, are known numbers. It is
> required, therefore, to obtain, from these two equations, the
> two unknown quantities $$x$$ and $$y$$.
>
> **607.** The most natural method of proceeding will readily
> present itself to the mind; which is, to determine, from both
> equations, the value of one of the unknown quantities, as for
> example $$x$$, and to consider the equality of those two values;
> for then we shall have an equation, in which the unknown
> quantity $$y$$ will be found by itself, and may be determined
> by the rules already given. Then, knowing $$y$$, we shall have
> only to substitute its value in one of the quantities that
> express $$x$$.
>
> **608.** According to this rule, wo obtain from the first
equation, $$x=\dfrac{c-by}{a}$$, and from the second, $$x=\dfrac{h-gy}{f}$$:
then putting these vaues equal to each other, we have this
new equation:
>
> $$\dfrac{c-by}{a}=\dfrac{h-gy}{f}$$;
>
> multiplying by $$a$$, the product is $$c-by=\dfrac{ah-agy}{f}$$; and then by $$f$$,
> the product is $$fc-fby = ah-agy$$; adding $$agy$$, we have $$fc-fby+agy = ah$$; subtracting $$fc$$,
> gives $$-fby+agy = ah-fc$$; or $$(ag-bf)y = ah-fc$$; lastly, dividing by $$ag-bf$$, we have
>
> $$y = \dfrac{ah-fc}{ag-bf}$$.
>
> In order now to substitute this value of $$y$$ in one of the
> two values which we have found of $$x$$, as in the first, where
> $$x=\dfrac{c-by}{a}$$, we shall first have
>
> $$-by = - \dfrac{abh-bcf}{ag-bf}$$;
>
> whence
> $$\begin{align*}
c-by &= c- \dfrac{abh-bcf}{ag-bf}\\
&=\dfrac{acg-bcf-abh+bcf}{ag-bf}\\
&=\dfrac{acg-abh}{ag-bf};
\end{align*}
$$
> 
> and dividing by $$a$$,
>
> $$x = \dfrac{c-by}{a} = \dfrac{cg-bh}{ag-bf}$$.
>
> **609.** *Question 1.* To illustrate this method by examples,
> let it be proposed to find two numbers, whose sum may be
> 15, and difference 7.
