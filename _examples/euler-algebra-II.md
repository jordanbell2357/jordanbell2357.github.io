> 573\. When the number sought, or the unknown quantity,
> is represented by the letter $$x$$, and the equation we have
> obtained is such, that one side contains only that $$x$$, and the
> other simply a known number, as, for example, $$x=25$$, the
> value of $$x$$ is already known. We must always endeavour,
> therefore, to arrive at such a form, however complicated
> the equation may be when first obtained: and, in the
> course of this section, the rules shall be given, and
> explained, which serve to facilitate these reductions.
>
> 581\. When there are terms containing $$x$$ on both sides
of the equation, we begin by making such terms vanish
from that side from which it is most easily expunged; that
is to say, in which there are the fewest terms so involved.
>
> If we have, for example, the equation $$3x+2=x+ 10$$,
> we must first subtract $$x$$ from both sides, which gives
> $$2x+2= 10$$; wherefore $$2x=8$$, and $$x=4$$. 
>
> Let $$x + 4 = 20 - x$$; here it is evident that
> $$2x + 4 = 20$$; and consequently $$2x= 16$$, and $$x=8$$.
>
> Let $$x+8=32-3x$$, this gives us $$4x+8=32$$; or $$4x=24$$,
> whence $$x=6$$.
>
> Let $$15-x=20-2x$$, here we shall have
> $$15 +x=20$$, and $$x=5$$.
>
> Let 1 +x=5-tx; this becomes I +ix=5, or ix=4 ;
> therefore 3x=8; and lastly, x=t=2%.
>
> If t-tx=~-tx,
> we must add tx, which gives t=
> -t +T\X; subtracting t, and transposing the terms, there
> remains T'ix=t; then multiplying by 12, we obtain x=2.
>
> If It-%x=t+tx, we add %x, which gives 1t=t+
> ix; then subtracting t, and transposing, we have ix= It,
> whence, by multiplying by 6 and dividing by 7, we de-
> duce x=I-h=H.
>
> 582\. If we have an equation in which the unknown
> number x is a denominator, we must make the fraction vanish
> by multiplying the whole equation by that denominator.
> Suppose that we have found 100 -8= 12, then, adding
> x
> 8, we have 100 = 20; and multiplying by x, it becomes
> 100=20x; lastly, dividing by 20, we find x=5.
> Dx+3
> Let now --1- = 7; here, multiplying by x -
> 1, we
> x-
> have 5x+3=7x-7 ; and subtracting 5x, there remains
> 3 =2x-7; then adding 7, we have 2x= 10; whence
> ·x=5.

> Question 21. If 3.t:-4 = 5x-6' then will x=12.
