#### Section IV. "Of Algebraic Equations, and the Resolution of Them." Chapter 6. "Of the Resolution of Mixed Equations of the Second Degree."

> **638.** An equation of the second degree is said to be mixt,
> or complete, when three terms are found in it, namely, that
> which contains the square of the unknown quantity, as $$ax^2$$;
> that, in which the unknown quantity is found only in the
> first power, as $$bx$$; and, lastly, the term which is composed
> of only known quantities. And since we may unite two or
> more terms of the same kind into one, and bring all the
> terms to one side of the sign =, the general form of a mixt
> equation of the second degree will be
>
$$ax^2 \pm bx \pm c =0.$$
>
> In this chapter, we shall show how the value of $$x$$ may be
> derived from such equations: and it will be seen, that there
> are two methods of obtaining it.
>
> **639.** An equation of the kind that we are now considering
> may be reduced, by division, to such a form, that the first
> term may contain only the square, $$x^2$$, of the unknown quantity $$x$$.
> We shall leave the second term on the same side
> with $$x$$, and transpose the known term to the other side of
> the sign =. By these means our equation will assume the
> form of $$x^2 \pm px = \pm q$$,
> in which $$p$$ and $$q$$ represent any
> known numbers, positive or negative; and the whole is at
> present reduced to determining the true value of $$x$$. We shall
> begin by remarking, that if $$x^2 + px$$ were a real square, the
> resolution would be attended with no difficulty, because
> it would only be required to take the square root of both
> sides.
>
> **640.** But it is evident that $$x^2+px$$ cannot be a square;
> since we have already seen, (**Art. 307.**) that if a root consists of two terms,
> for example, $$x+n$$, its square always
> contains three terms, namely, twice the product of the two
> parts, beside the square of each part; that is to say, the
> square of $$x+n$$ is $$x^2+2nx+n^2$$. Now, we have already
> on one side $$x^2+px$$;, we may, therefore, consider $$x^2$$ as the
> square of the first part of the root, and in this case $$p$$x must
> represent twice the product of $$x$$, the first part of the root,
> by the second part: consequently, this second part must be
> $$\frac{1}{2}p$$, and in fact the square of $$x+\frac{1}{2}p$$, is found to be
>
$$x^2+px+\frac{1}{4}p^2.$$
>
> **641.** Now, $$x^2+px+\frac{1}{4}p^2$$ being a real square, which has for its root
> $$x+\frac{1}{2}p$$, if we resume our equation $$x^2+px=q$$, we have only to add
> $$\frac{1}{2}p^2$$ to both sides, which gives us
>
$$x^2+px+\frac{1}{4}p^2=q+\frac{1}{4}p^2,$$
>
> the first side being actually a square,
> and the other containing only known quantities.
> If, therefore, we take the square root of both sides, we
> find $$x+\frac{1}{2}p=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q}$$; subtracting
> $$\frac{1}{2}p$$, we obtain
>
$$x=-\frac{1}{2}p+\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q};$$
>
> and, as every square root may be taken either affirmatively or negatively,
> we shall have for $$x$$ two values expressed thus;
>
$$x=-\frac{1}{2}p \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q}.$$
>
> **642.** This formula contains the rule by which all quadratic equations may be resolved;
> and it will be proper to commit it to memory, that it may not be necessary, every
> time, to repeat the whole operation which we have gone
> through. We may always arrange the equation in such a
> manner, that the pure square $$x^2$$ may be found on one side,
> and the above equation have the form $$x^2 = -px+q$$, where
> we see immediately that $$x=-\frac{1}{2}p \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q}$$.
>
> **643.** The general rule, therefore, which we deduce from
> that, in order to resolve the equation $$x^2 = -px+q$$, is
> founded on this consideration;
>
> That the unknown quantity $$x$$ is equal to half the coefficient,
> or multiplier of $$x$$ on the other side of the equation,
> plus or minus the square root of the square of this number,
> and the known quantity which forms the third term of the
> equation.
>
> Thus, if we had the equation $$x^2=6x+7$$, we should
> immediately say, that
>
$$x=3\pm \sqrt{9+7}=3 \pm 4,$$
>
> whence we have these two values of $$x$$, namely, $$x=7$$, and
> $$x=-1$$. In the same manner, the equation $$x^2=10x-9$$,
> would give
>
$$x=5 \pm \sqrt{25-9}=5 \pm 4,$$
>
> that is to say, the two values of $$x$$ are 9 and 1.
>
> **644.** This rule will be still better understood, by distinguishing
> the following cases: I), When $$p$$ is an even number; II), When $$p$$ is an odd number;
> and III), When $$p$$ is a fractional number.
>
> I) Let $$p$$ be an even number, and the equation such,
> that $$x^2=2px+q$$; we shall, in this case, have
>
$$x=p \pm \sqrt{p^2+q}.$$
>
> II) Let $$p$$ be an odd number, and the equation
> $$x^2=px+q$$; we shall here have
>
$$x=\frac{1}{2}p \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q};$$
>
> and since $$\frac{1}{4}p^2+q=\frac{p^2+4q}{4}$$, we may extract the square root
> of the denominator, and write
>
$$x=\frac{1}{2}p \pm \frac{\sqrt{p^2+4q}}{2} = \frac{p \pm \sqrt{p^2+4q}}{2}.$$
>
> III) Lastly, if $$p$$ be a fraction, the equation may be resolved in the
> following manner. Let the equation be $$ax^2=bx+c$$, or
> $$x^2=\frac{bx}{a}+\frac{c}{a}$$, and we shall have, by the rule,
>
$$x=\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2}+\frac{c}{a}}.$$
>
> Now,
>
$$\frac{b^2}{4a^2}+\frac{c}{a}=\frac{b^2+4ac}{4a^2},$$
>
> the denominator of which is a square; so that
>
$$x = \frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2+4ac}}{2a}.$$
>
> **645.** The other method of resolving mixt quadratic equations is,
> to transform them into pure equations; which is
> done by substitution: for example, in the equation
> $$x^2 = px + q$$, instead of the unknown quantity $$x$$, we may write
> another unknown quantity, $$y$$, such, that $$x = y + \frac{1}{2}p$$;
> by which means, when we have determined $$y$$, we may immediately find the value of $$x$$.
>
> If we make this substitution $$y+\frac{1}{2}p$$ instead of $$x$$,
> we have $$x^2=y^2+py+\frac{1}{4}p^2$$, and $$px=py+\frac{1}{2}p^2$$;
> consequently, our equation will become
>
$$y^2+py+\frac{1}{4}p^2=py+\frac{1}{2}p^2+q;$$
>
> which is first reduced, by subtracting $$py$$, to
>
$$y^2+\frac{1}{4}p^2=\frac{1}{2}p^2+q;$$
>
> and then, by subtracting $$\frac{1}{4}p^2$$, to $$y^2=\frac{1}{4}p^2+q$$. This is
> a pure quadratic equation, which immediately gives
>
$$y=\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q}.$$
>
> Now, since $$x=y+\frac{1}{2}p$$, we have
>
$$x=\frac{1}{2}p \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}p^2+q},$$
>
> as we found it before. It only remains, therefore, to illustrate
> this rule by some examples.
>
> **646.** *Question 1.* There are two numbers; the one exceeds
the other by 6, and their product is 91: what are those
numbers?
>
> If the less be $$x$$, the other will be $$x+6$$, and their product
> $$x^2+6x=91$$. Subtracting $$6x$$, there remains $$x^2=91-6x$$, and the rule gives
>
$$x=-3 \pm \sqrt{9+91} = -3 \pm 10;$$
>
> so that $$x=7$$, or $$x=-13$$.
>
> The question therefore admits of two solutions;
>
> By the one, the less number $$x=7$$, and the greater $$x+6=13$$.
>
> By the other, the less number $$x=-13$$, and the greater $$x+6=-7$$.
>
> **647.** *Question 2.* To find a number such, that if 9 be
> taken from its square, the remainder may be a number,
> as much greater than 100, as the number itself is less
> than 23.
>
> Let the number sought be $$x$$. We know that $$x^2 - 9$$ exceeds 100 by $$x^2-109$$:
> and since $$x$$ is less than 23 by $$23 - x$$, we have this equation
>
$$x^2-109=23-x.$$
>
> Therefore $$x^2=-x+132$$, and, by the rule,
>
$$x=-\frac{1}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+132} = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{529}{4}} = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{23}{2}.$$
>
> So that $$x=11$$, or $$x=-12$$.
>
> Hence, when only a positive number is required, that
> number will be 11, the square of which minus 9 is 112, and
> consequently greater than 100 by 12, in the same manner
> as 11 is less than 23 by 12.
>
> **648.** *Question 3.* To find a number such, that if we
> multiply its half by its third, and to the product add half
> the number required, the result will be 30.
