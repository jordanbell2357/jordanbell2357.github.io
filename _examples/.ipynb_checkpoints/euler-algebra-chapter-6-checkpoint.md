#### Section IV. "Of Algebraic Equations, and the Resolution of Them." Chapter 6. "Of the Resolution of Mixed Equations of the Second Degree."

> **638.** An equation of the second degree is said to be mixt,
> or complete, when three terms are found in it, namely, that
> which contains the square of the unknown quantity, as $$ax^2$$;
> that, in which the unknown quantity is found only in the
> first power, as $$bx$$; and, lastly, the term which is composed
> of only known quantities. And since we may unite two or
> more terms of the same kind into one, and bring all the
> terms to one side of the sign =, the general form of a mixt
> equation of the second degree will be
>
$$ax^2 \pm bx \pm c =0.$$
>
> In this chapter, we shall show how the value of $$x$$ may be
> derived from such equations: and it will be seen, that there
> are two methods of obtaining it.
>
> **639.** An equation of the kind that we are now considering
> may be reduced, by division, to such a form, that the first
> term may contain only the square, $$x^2$$, of the unknown quantity $$x$$.
> We shall leave the second term on the same side
> with $$x$$, and transpose the known term to the other side of
> the sign =. By these means our equation will assume the
> form of $$x^2 \pm px = \pm q$$,
> in which $$p$$ and $$q$$ represent any
> known numbers, positive or negative; and the whole is at
> present reduced to determining the true value of $$x$$. We shall
> begin by remarking, that if $$x^2 + px$$ were a real square, the
> resolution would be attended with no difficulty, because
> it would only be required to take the square root of both
> sides.
