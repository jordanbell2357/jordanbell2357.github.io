<span class="art">440</span> The *Geometrical ratio* of two numbers is found by
resolving the question, *How many times* is one of those
numbers greater than the other? This is done by dividing
one by the other; and the quotient will express the ratio
required.

<span class="art">441</span> We have here three things to consider; 

1. the first of the two given numbers, which is called the antecedent;
2. the other number, which is called the consequent;
3. the ratio of the two numbers, or the quotient arising from the division of the antecedent by the consequent.

For example, if the relation of the numbers 18 and 12 be required, 18 is the antecedent,
12 is the consequent, and the
ratio will be ¹⁸⁄₁₂ = 1½; whence we see that the antecedent
contains the consequent once and a half.

<span class="art">442</span> It is usual to represent geometrical relation by two
points, placed one above the other, between the antecedent
and the consequent. Thus, $$a:b$$ means the geometrical
relation of these two numbers, or the ratio of $$a$$ to $$b$$.

We have already remarked that this sign is employed to
represent division, and for this reason we make use of it
here; because, in order to know the ratio, we must divide
$$a$$ by $$b$$; the relation expressed by this sign being read
simply, $$a$$ is to $$b$$.

<span class="art">443</span> Relation therefore is expressed by a fraction, whose
numerator is the antecedent, and whose denominator is the
consequent; but perspicuity requires that this fraction
should be always reduced to its lowest terms: which is
done, as we have already shewn, by dividing both the
numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.
Thus, the fraction ¹⁸⁄₁₂ becomes ³⁄₂, by dividing both
terms by 6.

<span class="art">444</span> So that relations only differ according as their ratios
are different; and there are as many different kinds of geometrical relations
as we can conceive different ratios.

The first kind is undoubtedly that in which the ratio
becomes unity. This case happens wlien the two numbers
are equal, as in 3:3∷4:3∷$$a:a$$;
the ratio is here 1,
and for this reason we call it the relation of equality.

Next follow those relations in which the ratio is another
whole number. Thus, 4:2 the ratio is 2, and is called
double ratio; 12:4 the ratio is 3, and is called triple ratio:
24:6 the ratio is 4, and is called quadruple ratio, etc.

We may next consider those relations whose ratios are
expressed by fractions; such as 12:9, where the ratio is ⁴⁄₃,
or 1⅓; and 18:27, where the ratio is ⅔, etc. We may also
distinguish those relations in which the consequent contains
exactly twice, thrice, etc. the antecedent: such are the relations
6:12, 5:15, etc. the ratio of which some call subduple, subtriple, etc. ratios.

Farther, we call that ratio **rational** which is an expressible
number; the antecedent and consequent being integers, such
as 11:7, 8:15, etc. and we call that an **irrational** or **surd**
ratio, which can neither be exactly expressed by integers, nor
by fractions, such as √5:8, or 4:√3.

<span class="art">445</span> Let $$a$$ be the antecedent, $$b$$ the consequent, and $$d$$
the ratio, we know already that $$a$$ and $$b$$ being given, we
find $$d=\frac{a}{b}$$;
if the consequent $$b$$ were given with the ratio,
we should find the antecedent $$a = bd$$, because $$bd$$ divided
by $$b$$ gives $$d$$: and lastly, when the antecedent $$a$$ is given, and
the ratio $$d$$, we find the consequent $$b = \frac{b}{d}$$; for, dividing
the antecedent $$a$$ by the consequent $$\frac{a}{d}$$, we obtain the quotient $$d$$,
that is to say, the ratio.

<span class="art">446</span> Every relation $$a:b$$ remains the same, if we multiply or divide
the antecedent and consequent by the same
number, because the ratio is the same: thus, for example,
let $$d$$ be the ratio of $$a:b$$, we have $$d = \frac{a}{b}$$; now the ratio
of the relation $$na : nb$$ is also $$\frac{na}{nb}=d$$, and that of the relation
$$\frac{a}{n}:\frac{b}{n}$$ is $$\frac{na}{nb}=d$$.


<span class="art">447</span> When a ratio has been reduced to its lowest terms,
it is easy to perceive and enunciate the relation. For example, when the ratio
$$\frac{a}{b}$$ has been reduced to the fraction $$\frac{p}{q}$$,
we say

$$a : b = p : q,$$

or

$$a : b :: p : q,$$

which is read, $$a$$ is
to $$b$$ as $$p$$ is to $$q$$. Thus, the ratio of 6:3 being ²⁄₁, or 2, we
say 6:3∷2:1. We have likewise 18:12∷3:2, and
24:18∷4:3, and 30:45∷2:3, etc. But if the ratio
cannot be abridged, the relation will not become more evident;
for we do not simplify it by saying 9:7∷9:7.

<span class="art">448</span> On the other hand, we may sometimes change the
relation of two very great numbers into one that shall be
more simple and evident, by reducing both to their lowest
terms. Thus, for example, we can say, 28844:14422∷2:1;
or, 10566:7044∷3:2; or, 57600:25200∷16:7.

<span class="art">449</span> In order, therefore, to express any relation in the
clearest manner, it is necessary to reduce it to the smallest
possible numbers; which is easily done, by dividing the two
terms of it by their greatest common divisor. Thus, to reduce the
relation 57600:25200 to that of 16:7, we have
only to perform the single operation of dividing the numbers
57600 and 25200 by 3600, which is their greatest common divisor.

<span class="art">450</span> It is important, therefore, to know how to find the
greatest common divisor of two given numbers; but this
requires a Rule, which we shall explain in the following
chapter.
