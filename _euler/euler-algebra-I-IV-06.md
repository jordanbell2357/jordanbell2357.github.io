<span class="art">638</span> An equation of the second degree is said to be mixt,
or complete, when three terms are found in it, namely, that
which contains the square of the unknown quantity, as $$ax^2$$;
that, in which the unknown quantity is found only in the
first power, as $$bx$$; and, lastly, the term which is composed
of only known quantities. And since we may unite two or
more terms of the same kind into one, and bring all the
terms to one side of the sign =, the general form of a mixt
equation of the second degree will be

$$ax^2 \pm bx \pm c =0.$$

In this chapter, we shall show how the value of $$x$$ may be
derived from such equations: and it will be seen, that there
are two methods of obtaining it.

<span class="art">639</span> An equation of the kind that we are now considering
may be reduced, by division, to such a form, that the first
term may contain only the square, $$x^2$$, of the unknown quantity $$x$$.
We shall leave the second term on the same side
with $$x$$, and transpose the known term to the other side of
the sign =. By these means our equation will assume the
form of $$x^2 \pm px = \pm q$$,
in which $$p$$ and $$q$$ represent any
known numbers, positive or negative; and the whole is at
present reduced to determining the true value of $$x$$. We shall
begin by remarking, that if $$x^2 + px$$ were a real square, the
resolution would be attended with no difficulty, because
it would only be required to take the square root of both
sides.

<span class="art">640</span> But it is evident that $$x^2+px$$ cannot be a square;
since we have already seen, (<span class="artref">Art. 307</span>)
that if a root consists of two terms,
for example, $$x+n$$, its square always
contains three terms, namely, twice the product of the two
parts, beside the square of each part; that is to say, the
square of $$x+n$$ is $$x^2+2nx+n^2$$. Now, we have already
on one side $$x^2+px$$; we may, therefore, consider $$x^2$$ as the
square of the first part of the root, and in this case $$p$$x must
represent twice the product of $$x$$, the first part of the root,
by the second part: consequently, this second part must be
$$\frac{1}{2}p$$, and in fact the square of $$x+\frac{1}{2}p$$, is found to be

$$x^2+px+\frac{1}{4}p^2.$$

<span class="art">641</span> Now, $$x^2+px+\frac{1}{4}p^2$$ being a real square, which has for its root
$$x+\frac{1}{2}p$$, if we resume our equation $$x^2+px=q$$, we have only to add
$$\frac{1}{2}p^2$$ to both sides, which gives us

$$x^2+px+\frac{1}{4}p^2=q+\frac{1}{4}p^2,$$

the first side being actually a square,
and the other containing only known quantities.
If, therefore, we take the square root of both sides, we
find $$x+\frac{1}{2}p=\surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right)$$; subtracting
$$\frac{1}{2}p$$, we obtain

$$x=-\frac{1}{2}p+\surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right);$$

and, as every square root may be taken either affirmatively or negatively,
we shall have for $$x$$ two values expressed thus;

$$x=-\frac{1}{2}p \pm \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right).$$

<span class="art">642</span> This formula contains the rule by which all quadratic equations may be resolved;
and it will be proper to commit it to memory, that it may not be necessary, every
time, to repeat the whole operation which we have gone
through. We may always arrange the equation in such a
manner, that the pure square $$x^2$$ may be found on one side,
and the above equation have the form $$x^2 = -px+q$$, where
we see immediately that $$x=-\frac{1}{2}p \pm \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right)$$.

<span class="art">643</span> The general rule, therefore, which we deduce from
that, in order to resolve the equation $$x^2 = -px+q$$, is
founded on this consideration;

That the unknown quantity $$x$$ is equal to half the coefficient,
or multiplier of $$x$$ on the other side of the equation,
plus or minus the square root of the square of this number,
and the known quantity which forms the third term of the
equation.

Thus, if we had the equation $$x^2=6x+7$$, we should
immediately say, that

$$x=3\pm \surd(9+7)=3 \pm 4,$$

whence we have these two values of $$x$$, namely, $$x=7$$, and
$$x=-1$$. In the same manner, the equation $$x^2=10x-9$$,
would give

$$x=5 \pm \surd(25-9)=5 \pm 4,$$

that is to say, the two values of $$x$$ are 9 and 1.

<span class="art">644</span> This rule will be still better understood, by distinguishing
the following cases: I), When $$p$$ is an even number; II), When $$p$$ is an odd number;
and III), When $$p$$ is a fractional number.

I) Let $$p$$ be an even number, and the equation such,
that $$x^2=2px+q$$; we shall, in this case, have

$$x=p \pm \surd(p^2+q).$$

II) Let $$p$$ be an odd number, and the equation
$$x^2=px+q$$; we shall here have

$$x=\frac{1}{2}p \pm \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right);$$

and since $$\frac{1}{4}p^2+q=\frac{p^2+4q}{4}$$, we may extract the square root
of the denominator, and write

$$x=\frac{1}{2}p \pm \frac{\surd(p^2+4q)}{2} = \frac{p \pm \surd(p^2+4q)}{2}.$$

III) Lastly, if $$p$$ be a fraction, the equation may be resolved in the
following manner. Let the equation be $$ax^2=bx+c$$, or
$$x^2=\frac{bx}{a}+\frac{c}{a}$$, and we shall have, by the rule,

$$x=\frac{b}{2a} \pm \surd \left(\frac{b^2}{4a^2}+\frac{c}{a}\right).$$

Now,

$$\frac{b^2}{4a^2}+\frac{c}{a}=\frac{b^2+4ac}{4a^2},$$

the denominator of which is a square; so that

$$x = \frac{b \pm \surd(b^2+4ac)}{2a}.$$

<span class="art">645</span> The other method of resolving mixt quadratic equations is,
to transform them into pure equations; which is
done by substitution: for example, in the equation
$$x^2 = px + q$$, instead of the unknown quantity $$x$$, we may write
another unknown quantity, $$y$$, such, that $$x = y + \frac{1}{2}p$$;
by which means, when we have determined $$y$$, we may immediately find the value of $$x$$.

If we make this substitution $$y+\frac{1}{2}p$$ instead of $$x$$,
we have $$x^2=y^2+py+\frac{1}{4}p^2$$, and $$px=py+\frac{1}{2}p^2$$;
consequently, our equation will become

$$y^2+py+\frac{1}{4}p^2=py+\frac{1}{2}p^2+q;$$

which is first reduced, by subtracting $$py$$, to

$$y^2+\frac{1}{4}p^2=\frac{1}{2}p^2+q;$$

and then, by subtracting $$\frac{1}{4}p^2$$, to $$y^2=\frac{1}{4}p^2+q$$. This is
a pure quadratic equation, which immediately gives

$$y=\pm \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right).$$

Now, since $$x=y+\frac{1}{2}p$$, we have

$$x=\frac{1}{2}p \pm \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}p^2+q\right),$$

as we found it before. It only remains, therefore, to illustrate
this rule by some examples.

<span class="art">646</span> *Question 1.* There are two numbers; the one exceeds
the other by 6, and their product is 91: what are those
numbers?

If the less be $$x$$, the other will be $$x+6$$, and their product
$$x^2+6x=91$$. Subtracting $$6x$$, there remains $$x^2=91-6x$$, and the rule gives

$$x=-3 \pm \surd(9+91) = -3 \pm 10;$$

so that $$x=7$$, or $$x=-13$$.

The question therefore admits of two solutions;

By the one, the less number $$x=7$$, and the greater $$x+6=13$$.

By the other, the less number $$x=-13$$, and the greater $$x+6=-7$$.

<span class="art">647</span> *Question 2.* To find a number such, that if 9 be
taken from its square, the remainder may be a number,
as much greater than 100, as the number itself is less
than 23.

Let the number sought be $$x$$. We know that $$x^2 - 9$$ exceeds 100 by $$x^2-109$$:
and since $$x$$ is less than 23 by $$23 - x$$, we have this equation

$$x^2-109=23-x.$$

Therefore $$x^2=-x+132$$, and, by the rule,

$$x=-\frac{1}{2} \pm \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}+132\right) = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \surd \left(\frac{529}{4}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{23}{2}.$$

So that $$x=11$$, or $$x=-12$$.

Hence, when only a positive number is required, that
number will be 11, the square of which minus 9 is 112, and
consequently greater than 100 by 12, in the same manner
as 11 is less than 23 by 12.

<span class="art">648</span> *Question 3.* To find a number such, that if we
multiply its half by its third, and to the product add half
the number required, the result will be 30.

Supposing the number to be $$x$$, its half, multiplied by its third, will
give $$\frac{1}{6}x^2$$; so that $$\frac{1}{6}x^2+\frac{1}{2}x=30$$; and multiplying
by 6, we have $$x^2+3x=180$$, or $$x^2=-3x+180$$, which gives

$$x=-\frac{3}{2} \pm \surd \left(\frac{9}{4}+180\right) = -\frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{27}{2}.$$

Consequently, either $$x=12$$, or $$x=-15$$.

<span class="art">649</span> *Question 4.* To find two numbers, the one being
double the other, and such, that if we add their sum to their
product, we may obtain 90.

Let one of the numbers be $$x$$, then the other will be $$2x$$;
their product also will be $$2x^2$$ and if we add to this $$3x$$,
or their sum, the new sum ought to make 90. So that
$$2x^2 + 3x = 90$$; or $$2x^2 = 90 - 3x$$; whence $$x^2 = -\frac{3}{2}x+45$$;
and thus we obtain

$$x=-\frac{3}{4} \pm \surd \left(\frac{9}{16}+45\right)=-\frac{3}{4} \pm \frac{27}{4}.$$

Consequently, $$x=6$$ or $$x=-7\frac{1}{2}$$.

<span class="art">650</span> *Question 5.* A horse-dealer bought a horse for a
certain number of crowns, and sold it again for 119 crowns,
by which means his profit was as much per cent as the horse
cost him; what was his first purchase?

Suppose the horse cost $$x$$ crowns; then, as the dealer gains
$$x$$ per cent, we have this proportion

$$100:x::x:\frac{x^2}{100};$$

since therefore he has gained $$\frac{x^2}{100}$$, and the horse
originally cost him $$x$$ crowns, he must have sold it for $$x+\frac{x^2}{100}$$;
therefore $$x+\frac{x^2}{100}=119$$; and subtracting $$x$$, we have
$$\frac{x^2}{100}=-x+119$$; then multiplying by 100, we obtain
$$x^2=-100x+11900$$. Whence, by the rule, we find

$$x=-50 \pm \surd(2500+11900)=-50 \pm \surd 14400 = -50 \pm 120 = 70.$$

The horse therefore cost 70 crowns, and since the horsedealer gained 70 per cent when he sold it again, the profit
must have been 49 crowns. So that the horse must have
been sold again for 70+49, that is to say, for 119 crowns.

<span class="art">651</span> *Question 6.* A person buys a certain number of
pieces of cloth: he pays for the first 2 crowns, for the
second 4 crowns, for the third 6 crowns, and in the same
manner always 2 crowns more for each following piece.
Now, all the pieces together cost him 110: how many pieces
had he?

Let the number sought be $$x$$; then, by the question, the
purchaser paid for the different pieces of cloth in the following manner:

$$
\begin{array}{lllllllll}
\textrm{for the}&1&2&3&4&5&\ldots&x&\textrm{pieces}\\
\textrm{he pays}&2&4&6&8&10&\ldots&2x&\textrm{crowns.}
\end{array}
$$

It is therefore required to find the sum of the arithmetical
progression $$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + \cdots + 2x$$ which consists of
$$x$$ terms, that we may deduce from it the price of all the
pieces of cloth taken together. The rule which we have
already given for this operation requires us to add the last
term to the first; and the sum is $$2x + 2$$; which must be
multiplied by the number of terms $$x$$, and the product will
be $$2x^2+2x$$; lastly, if we divide by the difference 2, the
quotient will be $$x^2+x$$, which is the sum of the progression;
so that we have $$x^2+x = 110$$; therefore $$x^2=-x+110$$, and

$$x=-\frac{1}{2} + \surd \left(\frac{1}{4}+100\right) = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{21}{2} = 10.$$

And hence the number of pieces of cloth is 10.

<span class="art">652</span> *Question 7.* A person bought several pieces of
cloth for 180 crowns; and if he had received for the same
sum 3 pieces more, he would have paid 3 crowns less for
each piece. How many pieces did he buy?

Let us represent the number sought by $$x$$; then each piece
will have cost him $$\frac{180}{x}$$ crowns. Now, if the purchaser
had had $$x+3$$ pieces for 180 crowns, each piece would have cost
$$\frac{180}{x+3}$$ crowns; and, since this price is less than
the real price by three crowns, we have this equation,

$$\frac{180}{x+3}=\frac{180}{x}-3.$$

Multiplying by $$x$$, we obtain $$\frac{180x}{x+3}=180-3x$$;
dividing by 3, we have $$\frac{60x}{x+3}=60-x$$; and again,
multiplying by $$x+3$$, gives $$60x=180+57x-x^2$$; therefore
adding $$x^2$$, we shall have $$x^2+60x=180+57x$$; and subtracting
$$60x$$, we shall have $$x^2=-3x+180$$.

The rule consequently gives

$$x=-\frac{3}{2} + \surd \left(\frac{9}{4}+180\right)=-\frac{3}{2}+\frac{27}{2}=12.$$

He therefore bought for 180 crowns 12 pieces of cloth
at 15 crowns the piece; and if he had got 3 pieces more,
namely, 15 pieces for 180 crowns, each piece would have
cost only 12 crowns, that is to say, 3 crowns less.

<span class="art">653</span> *Question 8.* Two merchants enter into partnership
with a stock of 100 pounds; one leaves his money in the
partnership for three months, the other leaves his for two
months, and each takes out 99 pounds of capital and profit.
What proportion of the stock did they separately furnish?

Suppose the first partner contributed $$x$$ pounds, the other
will have contributed $$100 - x$$. Now, the former receiving
99*l.*, his profit is $$99 - x$$, which he has gained in three
months with the principal $$x$$; and since the second receives
also 99*l.*, his profit is $$x - 1$$, which he has gained in two
months with the principal $$100 -x$$; it is evident also,
that the profit of this second partner would have been
$$\frac{3x-3}{2}$$, if he had remained three months in the partnership:
and as the profits gained in the same time are in proportion
to the principals, we have the following proportion,

$$x:99-x ∷ 100-x:\frac{3x-3}{2}.$$

And the equality of the product of the extremes to that of
the means, gives the equation,

$$\frac{3x^2-3x}{2}=9900-199x+x^2;$$

then multiplying this by 2, we have

$$3x^2-3x=19800-398x+2x^2;$$

and subtracting $$2x^2,$$ we obtain

$$x^2-3x=19800-398x.$$

Adding $$3x$$, gives

$$x^2=19800-395x;$$

then by the rule,

$$x=-\frac{395}{2}+\surd \left(\frac{156025}{4}+\frac{79200}{4}\right)=-\frac{395}{2}+\frac{458}{2}
=\frac{90}{2}=45.$$

The first partner therefore contributed 45*l.* and the other
55*l.* The first having gained 54*l.* in three months, would
have gained in one month 18*l.*; and the second having
gained 44*l.* in two months, would have gained 22*l.* in one
month: now these profits agree; for if, with 45*l.*, 18*l.* are
gained in one month, 22*l.* will be gained in the same time
with 55*l.*

<span class="art">654</span> *Question 9.* Two girls carry 100 eggs to market;
the one had more than the other, and yet the sum which they
both received for them was the same. The first says to the
second. If I had had your eggs, I should have received 15
pence. The other answers, If I had had yours, I should
have received 6⅔ pence. How many eggs did each carry to
market?

Suppose the first had $$x$$ eggs; then the second must have
had $$100-x$$.

Since, therefore, the former would have sold $$100-x$$ eggs for 15 pence,
we have the following proportion:

$$(100-x):15 ∷ x:\frac{15}{100-x}.$$

Also, since the second would have sold $$x$$ eggs for 6⅔ pence,
we readily find how much she got for $$100-x$$ eggs, thus:

$$x:(100-x) ∷ \frac{20}{3} : \frac{2000-20x}{3x}.$$

Now, both the girls received the same money; we have
consequently the equation, $$\frac{15x}{100-x}{2000-2x}{3x}$$,
which becomes $$25x^2=200000-4000x$$; and lastely,

$$x^2=-160x+8000;$$

whence we obtain

$$x=-80 + \surd(6400+8000) = -80+120=40.$$

So that the first girl had 40 eggs, the second had 60, and
each received 10 pence.

<span class="art">655</span> *Question 10.* Two merchants sell each a certain
quantity of silk; the second sells 3 ells more than the first,
and they received together 35 crowns. Now, the first says
to the second, I should have got 24 crowns for your silk;
the other answers, And I should have got for yours 12
crowns and a half. How many ells had each? [^ell]

[^ell]: [Russ Rowlett: A Dictionary of Units of Measurement](https://www.ibiblio.org/units/dictE.html)
    
    > **elle** a traditional unit of distance in German speaking countries. The elle varied considerably, but it was always shorter than the English ell or French aune.
    > A typical value in northern Germany was exactly 2 fuss (German feet), which would be close to 24 inches or 60 centimeters. In the south, the elle was usually longer,
    > about 2.5 fuss. In Vienna, the elle was eventually standardized at 30.68 inches (77.93 centimeters). Although the German word *Elle* is often translated "yard"
    > in English, this is not a very good equivalent.

Suppose the first had $$x$$ ells; then the second must have had
$$x+3$$ ells; also, since the first would have sold $$x+3$$ ells
for 24 crowns, he must have received $$\frac{24x}{x+3}$$ crowns
for his $$x$$ ells. And, with regard to the second, since he would
have sold $$x$$ ells for 12½ crowns, he must have sold his
$$x+3$$ ells for $$\frac{25x+75}{2x}$$; so that the whole sum they
received was

$$\frac{24x}{x+3} + \frac{25x+75}{2x}=35 \; \textrm{crowns}.$$

This equation becomes

$$x^2=20x-75;$$

whence we have

$$x=10 \pm \surd(100-75)=10 \pm 5.$$

So that the question admits of two solutions: according
to the first, the first merchant had 15 ells, and the second
had 18; and since the former would have sold 18 ells for
24 crowns, he must have sold his 15 ells for 20 crowns.
The second, who would have sold 15 ells for 12 crowns and
a half, must have sold his 18 ells for 15 crowns; so that they
actually received 35 crowns for their commodity.

According to the second solution, the first merchant had
5 ells, and the other 8 ells; and since the first would have
sold 8 ells for 24 crowns, he must have received 15 crowns
for his 5 ells; also, since the second would have sold 5 ells
for 12 crowns and a half, his 8 ells must have produced
him 20 crowns; the sum being, as before, 35 crowns.
