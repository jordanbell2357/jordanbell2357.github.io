<span class="art">326</span> When it is required to add together two or more
irrational quantities, this is to be done, according to the
method before laid down, by writing all the terms in succession,
each with its proper sign: and, with regard to abbreviations,
we must remark that, instead of $$\surd a+\surd a$$, for
example, we may write $$2\surd a$$; and that $$\surd a-\surd a= 0$$,
because these two terms destroy one another. Thus, the
quantities 3 + √2 and 1 + √2, added together, make
4 + 2√2, or 4 + √8; the sum of 5 + √3 and 4 - √3,
is 9; and that of 2√3 + 3√2 and √3 - √2, is 3√3 + 2√2.

<span class="art">327</span> Subtraction also is very easy, since we have only to
add the proposed numbers, after having changed their signs;
as will be readily seen in the following example, by subtracting the lower line from the upper.

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
4&-\surd 2&+2\surd 3&-3\surd 5&+4\surd 6\\
1&+2\surd 2&-2\surd 3&-5\surd 5&+6\surd 6\\
\hline
3&-3\surd 2&-4\surd 3&+2\surd 5&-2\surd 6
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">328</span> In multiplication, we must recollect that $$\surd a$$
multiplied by $$\surd a$$ produces $$a$$;
and that if the numbers which follow the sign $$\surd$$ are different, as $$a$$ and $$b$$, we have $$\surd ab$$ for the product of $$\surd a$$ multiplied by $$\surd b$$.
After this, it will be easy to calculate the following examples:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
1&+\surd 2&&\\
1&+\surd 2&&\\
\hline
1&+\surd 2&&\\
&+\surd 2&+2&\\
\hline
1&+2\surd 2&+2&=3+2\surd 2.
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
4&+2\surd 2&\\
2&-\surd 2&\\
\hline
8&+4\surd 2&\\
&-4\surd 2&-4\\
\hline
8&-4&=4.
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">329</span> What we have said applies also to imaginary quantities; we shall only observe farther,
that $$\surd -a$$ multiplied by $$\surd -a$$ produces $$-a$$. If it were required to find the
cube of -1 + √-3, we should take the square of that
number, and then multiply that square by the same number;
as in the following operation:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
-1&+\surd -3&&\\
-1&+\surd -3&&\\
\hline
1&-\surd -3&&\\
&-\surd -3&-3&\\
\hline
1&-2\surd -3&-3&=-2-2\surd -3
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
-2&-2\surd -3&&\\
-1&+\surd -3&&\\
\hline
2&+2\surd -3&&\\
&-2\surd -3&+6&\\
\hline
2&+6&&=8
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">330</span> In the division of surds, we have only to express the
proposed quantities in the form of a fraction; which may be
then changed into another expression having a rational denominator;
for if the denominator be $$a+\surd b$$, for example,
and we multiply both this and the numerator by $$a-\surd b$$, the
new denominator will be $$a^2 - b$$, in which there is no radical
sign. Let it be proposed, for example, to divide 3 + 2√2
by 1 + √2: we shall first have $$\frac{3+2\surd 2}{1+\surd 2}$$; then multiplying
the two terms of the fraction by 1 - √2, we shall have for
the numerator:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
3&+2\surd 2&&\\
1&-\surd 2&&\\
\hline
3&+2\surd 2&&\\
&-3\surd 2&-4&\\
\hline
3&-\surd 2&-4&=-\surd 2-1;
\end{array}
$$

and for the denominator:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
1&+\surd 2&&\\
1&-\surd 2&&\\
\hline
1&+\surd 2&&\\
&-\surd 2&-2&\\
\hline
1&&-2&=-1.
\end{array}
$$

Our new fraction therefore is $$\frac{-\surd 2-1}{-1}$$; and if we again
multiply the two terms by -1, we shall have for the numerator
√2 + 1, and for the denominator +1. Now, it is easy to show that √2 + 1
is equal to the proposed fraction $$\frac{3+2\surd 2}{1+\surd 2}$$; for √2 + 1
being multiplied by the divisor 1 + √2, thus,

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
1&+\surd 2&&\\
1&+\surd 2&&\\
\hline
1&+\surd 2&&\\
&+\surd 2&+2&\\
\hline
1&+2\surd 2&+2&=3+2\surd 2.
\end{array}
$$

Another example. Let 8 - 5√2 be divided by 3 - 2√2.
This, in the first instance, is $$\frac{8-5\surd 2}{3-2\surd 2}$$;
and multiplying the two terms of this fraction by 3 + 2√2,
we have for the numerator,

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
8&-5\surd 2&&\\
3&+2\surd 2&&\\
\hline
24&-15\surd 2&&\\
&+16\surd 2&-20&\\
\hline
24&+\surd 2&-20&=4+\surd 2;
\end{array}
$$

and for the denominator,

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
3&-2\surd 2&&\\
3&+2\surd 2&&\\
\hline
9&-6\surd 2&&\\
&+6\surd 2&-8&\\
\hline
9&&-8&=1.
\end{array}
$$

Consequently, the quotient will be 4 + √2.
The truth of this may be proved, as before, by multiplication; thus,

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
4&+\surd 2&&\\
3&-2\surd 2&&\\
\hline
12&+3\surd 2&&\\
&-8\surd 2&-4&\\
\hline
12&-5\surd 2&-48&=8-5\surd 2.
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">331</span> In the same manner, we may transform irrational
fractions into others, that have rational denominators. If
we have, for example, the fraction $$\frac{1}{5-2\surd 6}$$,
and multiply its numerator and denominator by 5 + 2√6,
we transform it into this, $$\frac{5+2\surd 6}{1}=5+2\surd 6$$;
in like manner, the fraction $$\frac{2}{-1+\surd -3}$$ assumes this
form, $$\frac{2+2\surd -3}{-4}=\frac{1+\surd -3}{-2}$$;
also

$$\frac{\surd 6 + \surd 5}{\surd 6 - \surd 5}=\frac{11+2\surd 30}{1}
=11+2\surd 30.$$

<span class="art">332</span> When the denominator contains several terms, we
may, in the same manner, make the radical signs in it vanish
one by one. Thus, if the fraction $$\frac{1}{\surd 10 - \surd 2 - \surd 3}$$
be proposed, we first multiply these two terms by
√10 + √2 + √3, and obtain the fraction
$$\frac{\surd 10 + \surd 2 + \surd 3}{5-2\surd 6}$$; then
multiplying its numerator and denominator by 5 + 2√6,
we have 5√10 + 11√2 + 9√3 + 2√60.
