<span class="art">585</span> *Question 1.* To divide 7 into two such parts that the
greater may exceed the less by 3.

Let the greater part be $$x$$, then the less will be $$7-x$$; so
that $$x=7-x+3$$, or $$x=10-x$$. Adding $$x$$, we have
$$2x=10$$; and dividing by 2, $$x=5$$.

The two parts therefore are 5 and 2.

*Question 2.* It is required to divide $$a$$ into two parts, so
that the greater may exceed the less by $$b$$.

Let the greater part be $$x$$, then the other will be $$a-x$$; so that
$$x=a-x+b$$. Adding $$x$$, we have $$2x=a+b$$; and dividing by 2,
$$x=\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$.

Another method of solution. Let the greater part $$= x$$;
which as it exceeds the less by $$b$$, it is evident that this is less
than the other by $$b$$, and therefore must be $$= x - b$$. Now,
these two parts, taken together, ought to make $$a$$; so that
$$2x-b=a$$; adding $$b$$, we have $$2x=a+b$$, wherefore
$$x=\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$, which is the value of the greater part; and that of the
less will be $$\dfrac{a+b}{2}-b$$, or $$\dfrac{a+b}{2}-\dfrac{2b}{2}$$,
or $$\dfrac{a-b}{2}$$.

<span class="art">586</span> *Question 2.* A father leaves 1600 pounds to be
divided among his three sons in the following manner; namely,
the eldest is to have 200 pounds more than the second, and
the second 100 pounds more than the youngest. Required
the share of each.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Let the share of the third son be</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then the second's will be</td>
        <td>\(x+100\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the first son's share</td>
        <td>\(x+300\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, these three sums make up together 1600£; we have,
therefore,

$$
\begin{gather}
3x+400=1600\\
3x=1200\\
x=400
\end{gather}
$$

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The share of the youngest is</td>
        <td>400£</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the second is</td>
        <td>500£</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the eldest is</td>
        <td>700£</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">587</span> *Question 4.* A father leaves to his four sons 8600£
and, according to the will, the share of the eldest is to be
double that of the second, minus 100£; the second is to
receive three times as much as the third, minus 200£; and
the third is to receive four times as much as the fourth, minus
300£. What are the respective portions of these four sons?
