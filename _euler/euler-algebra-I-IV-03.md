<span class="art">585</span> *Question 1.* To divide 7 into two such parts that the
greater may exceed the less by 3.

Let the greater part be $$x$$, then the less will be $$7-x$$; so
that $$x=7-x+3$$, or $$x=10-x$$. Adding $$x$$, we have
$$2x=10$$; and dividing by 2, $$x=5$$.

The two parts therefore are 5 and 2.

*Question 2.* It is required to divide $$a$$ into two parts, so
that the greater may exceed the less by $$b$$.

Let the greater part be $$x$$, then the other will be $$a-x$$; so that
$$x=a-x+b$$. Adding $$x$$, we have $$2x=a+b$$; and dividing by 2,
$$x=\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$.

Another method of solution. Let the greater part $$= x$$;
which as it exceeds the less by $$b$$, it is evident that this is less
than the other by $$b$$, and therefore must be $$= x - b$$. Now,
these two parts, taken together, ought to make $$a$$; so that
$$2x-b=a$$; adding $$b$$, we have $$2x=a+b$$, wherefore
$$x=\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$, which is the value of the greater part; and that of the
less will be $$\dfrac{a+b}{2}-b$$, or $$\dfrac{a+b}{2}-\dfrac{2b}{2}$$,
or $$\dfrac{a-b}{2}$$.

<span class="art">586</span> *Question 2.* A father leaves 1600 pounds to be
divided among his three sons in the following manner; namely,
the eldest is to have 200 pounds more than the second, and
the second 100 pounds more than the youngest. Required
the share of each.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Let the share of the third son be</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then the second's will be</td>
        <td>\(x+100\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the first son's share</td>
        <td>\(x+300\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, these three sums make up together 1600 pounds; we have,
therefore,

$$
\begin{gather}
3x+400=1600\\
3x=1200\\
x=400
\end{gather}
$$

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The share of the youngest is</td>
        <td>400 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the second is</td>
        <td>500 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the eldest is</td>
        <td>700 pounds</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">587</span> *Question 4.* A father leaves to his four sons 8600 pounds
and, according to the will, the share of the eldest is to be
double that of the second, minus 100 pounds; the second is to
receive three times as much as the third, minus 200 pounds; and
the third is to receive four times as much as the fourth, minus
300 pounds. What are the respective portions of these four sons?

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Call the youngest son's share</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then the third son's is</td>
        <td>\(4x-300\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second son's is</td>
        <td>\(12x-1100\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the eldest's</td>
        <td>\(24x-2300\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, the sum of these four shares must make 8600 pounds We
have, therefore, $$41x - 3700 = 8600$$, or
$$41x=12300$$, and $$x=300$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Therefore the youngest's share is</td>
        <td>300 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The third son's</td>
        <td>900 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second's</td>
        <td>2500 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The eldest's</td>
        <td>4900 pounds</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">588</span> *Question 5.* A man leaves 11000 crowns to be
divided between his widow, two sons, and three daughters.
He intends that the mother should receive twice the share
of a son, and that each son should receive twice as much
as a daughter. Required how much each of them is to
receive.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Suppose the share of each daughter to be</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then each son's is consequently</td>
        <td>\(2x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the widow's</td>
        <td>\(4x\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The whole inheritance, therefore, is $$3x+4x+4x$$;
or $$1x=11000$$, and, consequently, $$x=1000$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Each daughter, therefore, is to receive</td>
        <td>1000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>So that the three receive in all</td>
        <td>3000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Each son receives</td>
        <td>2000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>So that the two sons receive</td>
        <td>4000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the mother receives</td>
        <td>4000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sum</td>
        <td>11000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">589</span> *Question 6.* A father intends by his will, that his
three sons should share his property in the following manner:
the eldest is to receive 1000 crowns less than half the
whole fortune; the second is to receive 800 crowns less
than the third of the whole; and the third is to have
600 crowns less than the fourth of the whole. Required
the sum of the whole fortune, and the portion of each
son.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Let the fortune be expressed by</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The share of tlie first son is</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{2}x-1000\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the second</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{3}x-800\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the third</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{4}x-600\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

So that the three sons receive in all
$$\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{4}x-2400$$,
and this sum must be equal to $$x$$. We have, therefore, the equation
$$\frac{13}{12}x-2400=0$$; then adding 2400, we have
$$\frac{1}{12}x=2400$$; and, lastly, multiplying by 12, we obtain
$$x=28800$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The fortune, therefore, consists of</td>
        <td>28800 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The eldest son receives</td>
        <td>13400 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second</td>
        <td>8800 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The youngest</td>
        <td>6600 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sum</td>
        <td>28800 crowns</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">590</span> *Question 7.* A father leaves four sons, who share
his property in the following manner: the first takes the
half of the fortune, minus 3000 pounds; the second takes the
third, minus 1000 pounds; the third takes exactly the fourth of
the property; and the fourth takes 600 pounds and the fifth part
of the property. What was the whole fortune, and how
much did each son receive?
