<span class="art">585</span> *Question 1.* To divide 7 into two such parts that the
greater may exceed the less by 3.

Let the greater part be $$x$$, then the less will be $$7-x$$; so
that $$x=7-x+3$$, or $$x=10-x$$. Adding $$x$$, we have
$$2x=10$$; and dividing by 2, $$x=5$$.

The two parts therefore are 5 and 2.

*Question 2.* It is required to divide $$a$$ into two parts, so
that the greater may exceed the less by $$b$$.

Let the greater part be $$x$$, then the other will be $$a-x$$; so that
$$x=a-x+b$$. Adding $$x$$, we have $$2x=a+b$$; and dividing by 2,
$$x=\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$.

Another method of solution. Let the greater part $$= x$$;
which as it exceeds the less by $$b$$, it is evident that this is less
than the other by $$b$$, and therefore must be $$= x - b$$. Now,
these two parts, taken together, ought to make $$a$$; so that
$$2x-b=a$$; adding $$b$$, we have $$2x=a+b$$, wherefore
$$x=\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$, which is the value of the greater part; and that of the
less will be $$\dfrac{a+b}{2}-b$$, or $$\dfrac{a+b}{2}-\dfrac{2b}{2}$$,
or $$\dfrac{a-b}{2}$$.

<span class="art">586</span> *Question 2.* A father leaves 1600 pounds to be
divided among his three sons in the following manner; namely,
the eldest is to have 200 pounds more than the second, and
the second 100 pounds more than the youngest. Required
the share of each.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Let the share of the third son be</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then the second's will be</td>
        <td>\(x+100\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the first son's share</td>
        <td>\(x+300\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, these three sums make up together 1600 pounds; we have,
therefore,

$$
\begin{gather}
3x+400=1600\\
3x=1200\\
x=400
\end{gather}
$$

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The share of the youngest is</td>
        <td>400 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the second is</td>
        <td>500 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the eldest is</td>
        <td>700 pounds</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">587</span> *Question 4.* A father leaves to his four sons 8600 pounds
and, according to the will, the share of the eldest is to be
double that of the second, minus 100 pounds; the second is to
receive three times as much as the third, minus 200 pounds; and
the third is to receive four times as much as the fourth, minus
300 pounds. What are the respective portions of these four sons?

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Call the youngest son's share</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then the third son's is</td>
        <td>\(4x-300\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second son's is</td>
        <td>\(12x-1100\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the eldest's</td>
        <td>\(24x-2300\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, the sum of these four shares must make 8600 pounds We
have, therefore, $$41x - 3700 = 8600$$, or
$$41x=12300$$, and $$x=300$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Therefore the youngest's share is</td>
        <td>300 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The third son's</td>
        <td>900 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second's</td>
        <td>2500 pounds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The eldest's</td>
        <td>4900 pounds</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">588</span> *Question 5.* A man leaves 11000 crowns to be
divided between his widow, two sons, and three daughters.
He intends that the mother should receive twice the share
of a son, and that each son should receive twice as much
as a daughter. Required how much each of them is to
receive.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Suppose the share of each daughter to be</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then each son's is consequently</td>
        <td>\(2x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the widow's</td>
        <td>\(4x\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The whole inheritance, therefore, is $$3x+4x+4x$$;
or $$1x=11000$$, and, consequently, $$x=1000$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Each daughter, therefore, is to receive</td>
        <td>1000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>So that the three receive in all</td>
        <td>3000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Each son receives</td>
        <td>2000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>So that the two sons receive</td>
        <td>4000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>And the mother receives</td>
        <td>4000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sum</td>
        <td>11000 crowns</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">589</span> *Question 6.* A father intends by his will, that his
three sons should share his property in the following manner:
the eldest is to receive 1000 crowns less than half the
whole fortune; the second is to receive 800 crowns less
than the third of the whole; and the third is to have
600 crowns less than the fourth of the whole. Required
the sum of the whole fortune, and the portion of each
son.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Let the fortune be expressed by</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The share of tlie first son is</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{2}x-1000\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the second</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{3}x-800\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>That of the third</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{4}x-600\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

So that the three sons receive in all
$$\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{4}x-2400$$,
and this sum must be equal to $$x$$. We have, therefore, the equation
$$\frac{13}{12}x-2400=0$$; then adding 2400, we have
$$\frac{1}{12}x=2400$$; and, lastly, multiplying by 12, we obtain
$$x=28800$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The fortune, therefore, consists of</td>
        <td>28800 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The eldest son receives</td>
        <td>13400 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second</td>
        <td>8800 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The youngest</td>
        <td>6600 crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sum</td>
        <td>28800 crowns</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">590</span> *Question 7.* A father leaves four sons, who share
his property in the following manner: the first takes the
half of the fortune, minus 3000 pounds; the second takes the
third, minus 1000 pounds; the third takes exactly the fourth of
the property; and the fourth takes 600 pounds and the fifth part
of the property. What was the whole fortune, and how
much did each son receive?

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Let the whole fortune be represented by</td>
        <td>\(x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Then the eldest son will have</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{2}x-3000\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{3}x-1000\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The third</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{4}x\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The youngest</td>
        <td>\(\frac{1}{5}x+600\)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

And the four will have received in all

$$\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{1}{5}x-3400,$$

which must be equal to $$x$$.

Whence results the equation $$\frac{77}{60}x-3400=x$$; then
subtracting $$x$$, we have $$\frac{17}{60}x-3400=0$$; adding
3400, we obtain $$\frac{17}{60}x=3400$$; then dividing by 17,
we have $$\frac{1}{60}x=200$$; and multiplying by 60, gives
$$x=12000$$.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>The fortune therefore consisted of</td>
        <td>12000*l.*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The first son received</td>
        <td>3000*l.*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The second</td>
        <td>3000*l.*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The third</td>
        <td>3000*l.*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The fourth</td>
        <td>3000*l.*</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<span class="art">591</span> *Question 8.* To find a number such, that if we
add to it its half, the sum exceeds 60 by as much as the
number itself is less than 65.

Let the number be represented by $$x$$:

Then $$x+\frac{1}{2}x-60=65-x$$, or $$\frac{3}{2}x-60=65-x$$.
Now, by adding $$x$$, we have $$\frac{5}{2}x-60=65$$; adding 60,
we have $$\frac{5}{2}x=125$$; dividing by 5, gives $$\frac{1}{2}x=25$$;
and multiplying by 2, we have $$x=50$$.

Consequently, the number sought is 50.

<span class="art">592</span> *Question 9.* To divide 32 into two such parts, that
if the less be divided by 6, and the greater by 5, the two
quotients taken together may make 6.

Let the less of the two parts sought be $$x$$; then the
greater will be $$32-x$$. The first, divided by 6, gives
$$\frac{x}{6}$$; and the second, divided by 5, gives $$\frac{32-x}{5}$$.
Now $$\frac{x}{6}+\frac{32-x}{5}=6$$: so that multiplying by 5, we have
$$\frac{5}{6}x+32-x=30$$, or $$-\frac{1}{6}x+32=30$$; adding $$\frac{1}{6}x$$,
we have $$32=30+\frac{1}{6}x$$; subtracting 30, there remains $$2=\frac{1}{6}x$$;
and lastly, multiplying by 6, we have $$x=12$$.

So that the less part is 12, and the greater part is 20.

<span class="art">593</span> *Question 10.* To find such a number, that if multiplied by 5, the product shall be as much less than 40 as
the number itself is less than 12.

Let the number be $$x$$; which is less than 12 by $$12-x$$;
then taking the number $$x$$ five times, we have $$5x$$, which is
less than 40 by $$40-5x$$, and this quantity must be equal to
$$12-x$$.

We have, therefore, $$40-5x=12-x$$. Adding $$5x$$,
we have $$40=12+4x$$; and subtracting 12, we obtain
$$28=4x$$; lastly, dividing by 4, we have $$x=7$$,
the number sought.

<span class="art">594</span> *Question 11.* To divide 25 into two such parts,
that the greater may be equal to 49 times the less.

Let the less part be $$x$$, than the greater will be $$25-x$$;
and the latter divided by the former ought to give the
quotient 49: we have therefore $$\frac{25-x}{x}=49$$. Multiplying
by $$x$$, we have $$25-x=49x$$; adding $$x$$, we have
$$25=50x$$; and dividing by 50, gives $$x=\frac{1}{2}$$.

The less of the two numbers is ½, and the greater is 24½;
dividing therefore the latter by ½, or multiplying by 2,
we obtain 49.

<span class="art">595</span> *Question 12.* To divide 48 into nine parts, so that
every part may be always ½ greater than the part which
precedes it.

Let the first, or least part, be $$x$$, then the second will be $$x+\frac{1}{2}$$,
the third $$x+1$$, etc.

Now, these parts form an arithmetical progression, whose
first term is $$x$$; therefore the ninth and last term will be
$$x + 4$$. Adding those two terms together, we have $$2x + 4$$;
multiplying this quantity by the number of terms, or by 9,
we have $$18x + 36$$; and dividing this product by 2, Ave
obtain the sum of all the nine parts $$= 9x + 18$$; which
ought to be equal to 48. We have, therefore, $$9x + 18 = 48$$;
subtracting 18, there remains $$9x=30$$; and dividing
by 9, we have $$x=3\frac{1}{3}$$.

The first part, therefore, is 3⅓, and the nine parts will
succeed in the following order:

<table>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3⅓</td>
<td>+ 3⅚</td>
<td>+ 4⅓</td>
<td>+ 4⅚</td>
<td>+ 5⅓</td>
<td>+ 5⅚</td>
<td>+ 6⅓</td>
<td>+ 6⅚</td>
<td>+ 7⅓</td>
</tr>
</table>

which together make 48.
