<span class="art">282</span> When we wish simply to represent division, we
make use of the usual mark of fractions; which is, to write
the denominator under the numerator, separating them by a
line; or to enclose each quantity between parentheses, placing
two points between the divisor and dividend, and a line between them.
Thus, if it were required, for example, to
divide $$a + b$$ by $$c + d$$, we should represent the quotient
thus; $$\frac{a+b}{c+d}$$, according to the former method; and thus,
$$(a + b):(c + d)$$
according to the latter, where each expression is read $$a + b$$
divided by $$c + d$$.

<span class="art">283</span> When it is required to divide a compound quantity by a simple one,
we divide each term separately, as in the following examples:

$$
\begin{gather}
(6a-8b+4c):(2) = 3a-4b+2c\\
(a^2-2ab):(a) = a-2b\\
(a^3-2aab+3abb):(a) = aa-2ab+3bb\\
(4aa-6aac+8abc):(2a) = 2ab-3ac+4bc\\
(9aabc-12abbc+15abcc):(3abc) = 3a-4b+5c, \textrm{etc.}
\end{gather}
$$

<span class="art">284</span> If it should happen that a term of the dividend is
not divisible by the divisor, the quotient is represented
by a fraction, as in the division of $$a+b$$ by $$a$$, which
gives $$1+\frac{b}{a}$$.
Likewise,

$$(aa-ab+bb):(aa) = 1-\frac{b}{a}+\frac{bb}{aa}.$$

In the same manner, if we divide $$2a+b$$ by 2, we obtain
$$a+\frac{b}{2}$$: and here it may be remarked, that we may
write $$\frac{1}{2}b$$, instead of $$\frac{b}{2}$$, because $$\frac{1}{2}$$
times $$b$$ is equal to $$\frac{b}{2}$$; and, in the same manner,
$$\frac{b}{3}$$ is the same as $$\frac{1}{3}b$$, and $$\frac{2b}{3}$$
the same as $$\frac{2}{3}b$$, etc.

<span class="art">285</span> But when the divisor is itself a compound quantity, division becomes more difficult.
This frequently occurs where we least expect it; and when it cannot be performed, we must
content ourselves with representing the quotient by a fraction, in the manner that we have
already described. At present, we will begin by considering some cases in which actual division takes place.

<span class="art">286</span> Suppose, for example, it were required to divide $$ac-bc$$ by $$a-b$$,
the quotient must here be such as, when multiplied by the divisor $$a - b$$,
will produce the dividend $$ac - bc$$. Now, it is evident, that this quotient must include $$c$$,
since without it we could not obtain $$ac$$; in order therefore to
try whether $$c$$ is the whole quotient, we have only to multiply it by the divisor, and see if
that multiplication produces the whole dividend, or only a part of it. In the present case,
if we multiply $$a - b$$ by $$c$$, we have $$ac - bc$$, which is exactly the dividend;
so that $$c$$ is the whole quotient. It is no less evident, that

$$
\begin{gather}
(aa+ab):(a+b)=a\\
(3aa-2ab):(3a-2b)=a\\
(6aa-9ab):(2a-3b)=3a, \textrm{etc.}
\end{gather}
$$

<span class="art">287</span> We cannot fail, in this way, to find a part of the
quotient; if, therefore, what we have found, when multiplied by the divisor, does not exhaust the dividend, we
have only to divide the remainder again by the divisor, in
order to obtain a second part of the quotient; and to continue the same method, until we have found the whole.

Let us, as an example, divide $$a^2+3ab+2b^2$$ by $$a+b$$.
It is evident, in the first place, that the quotient will include the term a, since otherwise we
should not obtain aa. Now, from the multiplication of the divisor $$a+b$$ by $$a$$, arises
$$aa+ab$$;
which quantity being subtracted from the dividend, leaves the remainder, $$2ab+2b^2$$;
and this remainder must also be divided by $$a+b$$, where it is evident that the quotient of this
division must contain the term $$2b$$. Now, $$2b$$, multiplied by $$a + b$$, produces $$2ab+2b^2$$;
consequently, $$a + 2b$$ is the quotient required; which multiplied by the divisor a + b,
ought to produce the dividend $$a^2+3ab+2b^2$$. See the operation.[^1]

<span class="art">288</span> This operation will be considerably facilitated by
choosing one of the terms of the divisor, which contains the
highest power, to be written first, and then, in arranging the
terms of the dividend, begin with the highest powers of that
first term of the divisor, continuing it according to the
powers of that letter. This term in the preceding example
was $$a$$. The following examples will render the process
more perspicuous.
