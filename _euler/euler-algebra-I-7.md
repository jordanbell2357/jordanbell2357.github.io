> **68.** When a number, as 7, for instance, is said not to be
> divisible by another number, let us suppose by 3, this only
> means, that the quotient cannot be expressed by an integer
> number; but it must not by any means be thought that it
> is impossible to form an idea of that quotient. Only
> imagine a line of 7 feet in length; nobody can doubt the
> possibility of dividing this line into 3 equal parts, and of
> forming a notion of the length of one of those parts.
>
> **69.** Since therefore we may form a precise idea of the
> quotient obtained in similar cases, though that quotient may
> not be an integer number, this leads us to consider a particular species of numbers,
> called fractions, or broken numbers; of which the instance adduced furnishes an illustration.
> For if we have to divide 7 by 3, we easily conceive the
> quotient which should result, and express it by $$\frac{7}{3}$$; placing
> the divisor under the dividend, and separating the two
> numbers by a stroke, or line.
>
> **70.** So, in general, when the number $$a$$ is to be divided by
> the number $$b$$, we represent the quotient by $$\frac{a}{b}$$, and call
> this form of expression a *fraction*. We cannot therefore
> give a better idea of a fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$, than by saying that it expresses
> the quotient resulting from the division of the upper
> number by the lower. We must remember also, that in all
> fractions the lower number is called the denominator, and
> that above the line the numerator.
>
> **71.** In the above fraction $$\frac{7}{3}$$, which we read seven thirds,
> 7 is the numerator, and 3 the denominator. We must also
> read $$\frac{2}{3}$$, two thirds; $$\frac{3}{4}$$, three fourths;
> $$\frac{3}{8}$$, three eighths; $$\frac{12}{100}$$,
> twelve hundredths; and $$\frac{1}{2}$$, one half, etc.
>
> **72.** In order to obtain a more perfect knowledge of the
> nature of fractions, we shall begin by considering the case
> in which the numerator is equal to the denominator, as in
> $$\frac{a}{a}$$. Now, since this expresses the quotient obtained by
> dividing $$a$$ by $$a$$, it is evident that this quotient is exactly
> unity, and that consequently the fraction $$\frac{a}{a}$$ is of the same
> value as 1, or one integer; for the same reason, all the following fractions,
>
$$\frac{2}{2}, \frac{3}{3}, \frac{4}{4}, \frac{5}{5}, \frac{6}{6}, \frac{7}{7}, \frac{8}{8}, \textrm{etc.}$$
