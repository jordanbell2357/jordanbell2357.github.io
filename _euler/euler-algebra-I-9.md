> **94.** When fractions have equal denominators, there is no difficulty
> in adding and subtracting them; for ²⁄₇ + ³⁄₇ is equal
> to ⁵⁄₇, and ⁴⁄₇ - ²⁄₇ is equal to ²⁄₇. In this case,
> therefore, either for addition or subtraction, we alter
> only the numerators, and place the common denominator
> under the line, thus;
>
> ⁷⁄₁₀₀ + ⁹⁄₁₀₀ - ¹²⁄₁₀₀ - ¹⁵⁄₁₀₀ + ²⁰⁄₁₀₀ is equal to ⁹⁄₁₀₀;
>
> ²⁴⁄₅₀ - ⁷⁄₅₀ - ¹²⁄₅₀ + ³¹⁄₅₀ is equal to ³⁶⁄₅₀, or ¹⁸⁄₂₅;
>
> ¹⁶⁄₂₀ - ³⁄₂₀ - ¹¹⁄₂₀ + ¹⁴⁄₂₀ is equal to ¹⁶⁄₂₀, or ⅘;
>
> also ⅓ + ⅔ is equal to ³⁄₃, or 1, that is to say, a whole;
> and ²⁄₄ - ¾ + ¼ is equal to ⁰⁄₄, that is to say, nothing, or 0.
>
> **95.** But when fractions have not equal denominators, we
> can always change them into other fractions that have the
> same denominator. For example, when it is proposed to
> add together the fractions ½ and ⅓, we must consider that ½
> is the same as ³⁄₆, and that ⅓
> is equivalent to ²⁄₆; we have
> therefore, instead of the two fractions proposed, ³⁄₆ + ²⁄₆, the
> sum of which is ⅚. And if the two fractions were united by
> the sign minus as ½ - ⅓, we should have ³⁄₆ - ²⁄₆, or ⅙.
>
> As another example, let the fractions proposed be ¾ + ⅝.
> Here, since ¾ is the same as ⁶⁄₈, this value may be substituted
> for ¾, and we may then say ⁶⁄₈ + ⅝ makes ¹¹⁄₈, or 1⅜.
>
> Suppose farther, that the sum of ⅓ and ⅓ were required, I
> say that it is ⁷⁄₁₂; for ⅓ = ⁴⁄₁₂, and ¼ = ³⁄₁₂: therefore
> ⁴⁄₁₂ + ³⁄₁₂ = ⁷⁄₁₂.
>
> **96.** We may have a greater number of fractions to reduce
> to a common denominator; for example, ½, ⅔, ¾, ⅘, ⅚. In
> this case, the whole depends on finding a number that shall
> be divisible by all the denominators of those fractions. In
> this instance, 60 is the number which has that property, and
> which consequently becomes the common denominator. We
> shall therefore have ³⁰⁄₆₀, instead of ½; ⁴⁰⁄₆₀, instead of ⅔;
> ⁴⁵⁄₆₀, instead of ¾; ⁴⁸⁄₆₀, instead of ⅘; and ⁵⁰⁄₆₀, instead of ⅚. If
> now it be required to add together all these fractions
> ³⁰⁄₆₀, ⁴⁰⁄₆₀, ⁴⁵⁄₆₀, ⁴⁸⁄₆₀, ⁵⁰⁄₆₀;
> we have only to add all the numerators,
> and under the sum place the common denominator 60; that
> is to say, we shall have ²¹³⁄₆₀, or 3 wholes, and the fractional
> remainder ¹¹⁄₂₀.
