<span class="art">115</span> The product of a number, when multiplied by
itself, is called a **square**; and, for this reason, the number,
considered in relation to such a product, is called a **square
root**. For example, when we multiply 12 by 12, the product
144 is a square, of which the root is 12.

The origin of this term is borrowed from geometry, which
teaches us that the contents of a square are found by multiplying its side by itself.

<span class="art">116</span> Square numbers are found therefore by multiplication;
that is to say, by multiplying the root by itself: thus,
1 is the square of 1, since 1 multiplied by 1 makes 1; likewise,
4 is the square of 2; and 9 the square of 3; 2 also is
the root of 4, and 3 is the root of 9.

We shall begin by considering the squares of natural
numbers; and for this purpose shall give the following small
Table, on the first line of which several numbers, or roots,
are ranged, and on the second their squares.

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">

<span class="art">117</span> Here it will be readily perceived that the series of
square numbers thus arranged has a singular property;
namely, that if each of them be subtracted from that which
immediately follows, the remainders always increase by 2,
and form this series;

3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, etc.

which is that of the odd numbers.

<span class="art">118</span> The squares of fractions are found in the same
manner, by multiplying any given fraction by itself. For
example, the square of ½ is ¼,

the square of ⅓ is ⅑  
the square of ⅔ is ⁴⁄₉  
the square of ¼ is ¹⁄₁₆  
the square of ¾ is ⁹⁄₁₆

We have only therefore to divide the square of the
numerator by the square of the denominator, and the
fraction which expresses that division will be the square of
the given fraction; thus, ²⁵⁄₆₄ is the square of ⅝; and reciprocally,
⅝ is the root of ²⁵⁄₆₄.

<span class="art">119</span> When the square of a mixed number, or a number
composed of an integer and a fraction, is required, we have
only to reduce it to a single fraction, and then take the
square of that fraction. Let it be required, for example, to
find the square of 2½; we first express this number by ⁵⁄₂,
and taking the square of that fraction, we have ²⁵⁄₄, or 6¼,
for the value of the square of 2½. Also to obtain the square
of 3¼, we say 3¼ is equal to ¹³⁄₄; therefore its square is equal
to ¹⁶⁹⁄₁₆, or to 10⁹⁄₁₆. The squares of the numbers between
3 and 4, supposing them to increase by one fourth, are as
follow:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Numbers.</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>3¼</td>
    <td>3½</td>
    <td>3¾</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Squares.</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10⁹⁄₁₆</td>
    <td>12¼</td>
    <td>14¹⁄₁₆</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
</table>

From this small Table we may infer, that if a root contain
a fraction, its square also contains one. Let the root, for
example, be 1⁵⁄₁₂; its square is ²⁸⁹⁄₁₄₄ or 2¹⁄₁₄₄; that is to say,
a little greater than the integer 2.

<span class="art">130</span> Let us now proceed to general expressions. First,
when the root is $$a$$, the square must be $$aa$$; if the root be
$$2a$$, the square is $$4aa$$; which shows that by doubling the
root, the square becomes 4 times greater; also, if the root
be $$3a$$, the square is $$9aa$$; and if the root be $$4a$$, the square
is $$16aa$$, Farther, if the root be $$ab$$, the square is $$aabb$$; and
if the root be $$abc$$, the square is $$aabbcc$$; or $$a^2b^2c^2$$.

<span class="art">131</span> Thus, when the root is composed of two, or more
factors, we multiply their squares together; and reciprocally,
if a square be composed of two, or more factors, of which
each is a square, we have only to multiply together the
roots of those squares, to obtain the complete root of the
square proposed. Thus, 2304 is equal to 4 · 16 · 36,
the square root of which is 2 · 4 · 6, or 48; and 48 is
found to be the true square root of 2304, because 48 · 48
gives 2304.

<span class="art">132</span> Let us now consider what must be observed on this
subject with regard to the signs + and -. First, it is
evident that if the root have the sign +, that is to say, if it
be a positive number, its square must necessarily be a positive
number also, because + multiplied by + makes +: hence
the square of $$+a$$ will be $$+aa$$: but if the root be a negative
number, as $$-a$$, the square is still positive, for it is $$+aa$$.
We may therefore conclude, that $$+aa$$ is the square both of
$$+a$$ and of $$-a$$, and that consequently every square has two
roots, one positive, and the other negative. The square root
of 25, for example, is both +5 and -5, because -5 multiplied by -5 gives 25,
as well as +5 by +5.
