### Part {{ page.part}}. {{ page.title }}

<span class="art">1</span> It has been shown, in the First Part, how one unknown
quantity is determined by a single equation, and how we
may determine two unknown quantities by means of two
equations, three unknown quantities by three equations, and
so on; so that there must always be as many equations as
there are unknown quantities to determine, at least when the
question itself is determinate.

When a question, therefore, does not furnish as many
equations as there are unknown quantities to be determined,
some of these must remain undetermined, and depend on
our will; for which reason, such questions are said to be
**indeterminate**; forming the subject of a particular branch of
algebra, which is called **Indeterminate Analysis**.

<span class="art">2</span> As in those cases we may assume any numbers for one,
or more unknown quantities, they also admit of several
solutions: but, on the other hand, as there is usually annexed the condition,
that the numbers sought are to be integer and positive, or at least rational,
the number of all the possible solutions of those questions is greatly limited: so
that often there are very few of them possible; at other
times, there may be an infinite number, but such as are not
readily obtained; and sometimes, also, none of them are
possible. Hence it happens, that this part of analysis frequently
requires artifices entirely appropriate to it, which are
of great service in exercising the judgment of beginners, and
giving them dexterity in calculation.

<span class="art">3</span> To begin with one of the easiest questions. Let it be
required to find two positive, integer numbers, the sum of
which shall be equal to 10.

Let us represent those members by $$x$$ and $$y$$; then we have
$$x+y = 10$$; and $$x = 10 - y$$, where $$y$$ is so far only determined,
that this letter must represent an integer and positive
number. We may therefore substitute for it all integer
numbers from 1 to infinity: but since $$x$$ must likewise be a
positive number, it follows, that it cannot be taken greater
than 10, for otherwise $$x$$ would become negative; and if
we also reject the value of $$x=0$$, we cannot make $$y$$ greater
than 9; so that only the following solutions can take
place
