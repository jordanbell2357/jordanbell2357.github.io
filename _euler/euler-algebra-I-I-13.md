<span class="art">139</span> We have already seen that the squares of numbers,
negative as well as positive, are always positive, or affected
by the sign +; having shown that $$-a$$ multiplied by $$-a$$
gives $$+aa$$, the same as the product of $$+a$$ by $$+a$$:
wherefore, in the preceding chapter, we supposed that all the
numbers, of which it was required to extract the square
roots, were positive.

<span class="art">140</span> When it is required, therefore, to extract the root of
a negative number, a great difficulty arises; since there is
no assignable number, the square of which would be a negative quantity.
Suppose, for example, that we wished to
extract the root of -4; we here require such a number as,
when multiplied by itself, would produce -4: now, this
number is neither +2 nor -2, because the square both of
+2 and of -2, is +4, and not -4.

<span class="art">141</span> We must therefore conclude, that the square root of
a negative number cannot be either a positive number or a
negative number, since the squares of negative numbers also
take the sign plus: consequently, the root in question must
belong to an entirely distinct species of numbers; since it
cannot be ranked either among positive or among negative
numbers.

<span class="art">142</span> Now, we before remarked, that positive numbers
are all greater than nothing, or 0, and that negative numbers
are all less than nothing, or 0; so that whatever exceeds 0
is expressed by positive numbers, and whatever is less than 0
is expressed by negative numbers. The square roots of
negative numbers, therefore, are neither greater nor less
than nothing; yet we cannot say, that they are 0; for 0
multiplied by produces 0, and consequently does not give
a negative number.

<span class="art">143</span> And, since all numbers which it is possible to conceive,
are either greater or less than 0, or are itself, it is
evident that we cannot rank the square root of a negative
number amongst possible numbers, and we must therefore
say that it is an impossible quantity. In this manner we are
led to the idea of numbers, which from their nature are impossible;
and therefore they are usually called **imaginary
quantities**, because they exist merely in the imagination.

<span class="art">144</span> All such expressions, as √-1, √-2, √-3, √-4,
etc. are consequently impossible, or imaginary numbers,
since they represent roots of negative quantities; and of
such numbers we may truly assert that they are neither
nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than nothing;
which necessarily constitutes them imaginary, or impossible.

<span class="art">145</span> But notwithstanding this, these numbers present
themselves to the mind; they exist in our imagination, and
we still have a sufficient idea of them; since we know that
by √-4 is meant a number which, multiplied by itself,
produces -4; for this reason also, nothing prevents us
from making use of these imaginary numbers, and employing them in calculation.

<span class="art">146</span> The first idea that occurs on the present subject is,
that the square of √-3, for example, or the product of
√-3 by √-3, must be -3; that the product of
√-1 by √-1 is -1;
and, in general, that by multiplying
$$\surd -a$$ by $$\surd -a$$, or by taking the square of $$\surd -a$$ we obtain $$-a$$.

<span class="art">147</span> Now, as $$-a$$ is equal to $$+1$$ multiplied by -1, and
as the square root of a product is found by multiplying together the roots of its factors,
it follows that the root of $$a$$
times -1, or $$\surd -a$$, is equal to $$\surd a$$ multiplied by $$\surd -1$$;
but $$\surd a$$ is a possible or real number, consequently the whole
impossibility of an imaginary quantity may be always reduced to √-1; for this reason,
√-4 is equal to √4 multiplied by √-1, or equal to 2√-1, because √4 is equal to
2; likewise √-9 is reduced to √9 · √-1, or 3√-1;
and √-16 is equal to 4√-1.

<span class="art">148</span> Moreover, as $$\surd a$$ multiplied by $$\surd b$$ makes $$\surd ab$$, we
shall have √6 for the value of √-2 multiplied by √-;
and √4, or 2, for the value of the product of √-1 by
√-4. Thus we see that two imaginary numbers, multiplied together, produce a real, or possible one. But, on the contrary, a possible number, multiplied by an
impossible number, gives always an imaginary product:
thus, √-3 by √+5, gives √-15.

<span class="art">149</span> It is the same with regard to division; for $$\surd a$$
divided by $$\surd b$$ making $$\frac{\surd a}{\surd b}$$, it is evident that
√-4 divided by √-1 will make √+4, or 2; that √+3 divided
by √-3 will give √-1; and that 1 divided by √-1
gives $$\frac{1}{\surd -1}$$, or √-1; because 1 is equal to √+1.[^1]

[^1]: 1 divided by √-1 is in fact -√-1; but indeed both √-1 and -√-1 are square roots of -1.

<span class="art">150</span> We have before observed, that the square root of
any number has always two values, one positive and the
other negative; that √4, for example, is both +2 and -2,
and that, in general, we may take $$-\surd a$$ as well as $$+\surd a$$
for the square root of $$a$$. This remark applies also to imaginary numbers;
the square root of $$-a$$ is both $$+\surd -a$$
and $$-\surd -a$$; but we must not confound the signs + and
-, which are before the radical sign √, with the sign which
comes after it.

<span class="art">151</span> It remains for us to remove any doubt, which may
be entertained concerning the utility of the numbers of
which we have been speaking; for those numbers being impossible, it would not
be surprising if they were thought
entirely useless, and the object only of an unfounded speculation.
This, however, would be a mistake; for the calculation of imaginary
quantities is of the greatest importance,
as questions frequently arise, of which we cannot immediately say whether
they include any thing real and possible,
or not; but when the solution of such a question leads to
imaginary numbers, we are certain that what is required is
impossible.

In order to illustrate what we have said by an example,
suppose it were proposed to divide the number 12 into two
such parts, that the product of those parts may be 40. If
we resolve this question by the ordinary rules, we find for
the parts sought 6 + √-4 and 6 - √-4;
but these numbers being imaginary, we conclude, that it is impossible to
resolve the question.

The difference will be easily perceived, if we suppose the
question had been to divide 12 into two parts which multiplied together
would produce 35; for it is evident that
those parts must be 7 and 5.
