### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 12. "Of Square Roots, and of Irrational Numbers resulting from them."

**123.** What we have said in the preceding chapter amounts
to this ; that the square root of a given number is that number whose square is equal to the given number; and that
we may put before those roots either the positive, or the
negative sign.

**124.** So that when a square number is given, provided
we retain in our memory a sufficient number of square numbers, it is easy to find its root.
If 196, for example, be the
given number, we know that its square root is 14.

Fractions, likewise, are easily managed in the same way.
It is evident, for example, that ⁵⁄₇
is the square root of ²⁵⁄₄₉;
to be convinced of which, we have only to take the square
root of the numerator and that of the denominator.

If the number proposed be a mixed number, as 12¼, we
reduce it to a single fraction, which, in this case, will be ⁴⁹⁄₄;
and from this we immediately perceive that ⁷⁄₂, or 3½, must
be the square root of 12¼.

**125.** But when the given number is not a square, as 12,
for example, it is not possible to extract its square root ; or
to find a number, which, multiplied by itself, will give the
product 12. We know, however, that the square root of 12
must be greater than 3, because 3 · 3 produces only 9;
and less than 4, because 4 · 4 produces 16, which is more
than 12; we know also, that this root is less than 3½, for we
have seen that the square of 3½, or ⁷⁄₂, is 12¼; and we may
approach still nearer to this root, by comparing it with 3⁷⁄₁₅;
for the square of 3⁷⁄₁₅, or of ⁵²⁄₁₅, is ²⁷⁰⁴⁄₂₂₅, or 12⁴⁄₂₂₅; so that this
fraction is still greater than the root required, though but very
little so, as the difference of the two squarcs is only ⁴⁄₂₂₅.

**126.** We may suppose that as 3½ and 3⁷⁄₁₅
are numbers
greater than the root of 12, it might be possible to add to 3
a fraction a little less than ⁷⁄₁₅, and precisely such, that the
square of the sum would be equal to 12.

Let us therefore try with 3³⁄₇, since ³⁄₇ is a little less than ⁷⁄₁₅.
Now 3³⁄₇ is equal to ²⁴⁄₇, the square of which is ⁵⁷⁶⁄₄₉, and consequently less
by ¹²⁄₄₉ than 12, which may be expressed by
⁵⁸⁸⁄₄₉. It is, therefore, proved that 3³⁄₇ is less, and that 3⁷⁄₁₅
is greater than the root required. Let us then try a number a little greater than
3³⁄₇, but yet less than 3⁷⁄₁₅; for example, 3⁵⁄₁₁; this number, which is equal to
³⁸⁄₁₁, has for its
square ¹⁴⁴⁴⁄₁₂₁; and by reducing 12 to this denominator, we
obtain ¹⁴⁵²⁄₁₂₁ which shows that 3⁵⁄₁₁ is still less than the root of
12, namely by ⁸⁄₁₂₁; let us therefore substitute for ⁵⁄₁₁ the fraction



,^j-, which is a little greater, and see what will be the result of
the comparison of the square of 3-;^, with the proposed number 12, Here the square of 3^%- is —q-' ; and 12 reduced to
the same denominator is VeV ' ^^ ^^^^ ^-rr *^ ^^^^^ ^^'^ small,
though only by -pig-, whilst 'i-^-^- has been found too great.
127. It is evident, therefore, that whatever fraction is
joined to 3, the square of that sum m.ust always contain a
fraction, and can never be exactly equal to the integer 12.
Thus, although we know that the square root of 12 is greater
than 3/y, and less than 3^, yet Ave are unable to assign an
intermediate fraction between these two, which, at the same
time, if added to 3, would express exactly the square root of
12 ; but notwithstanding this, we are not to assert that the
square root of 12 is absolutely and in itself indeterminate
:
it only follows from what has been said, that this root, though
it necessarily has a determinate magnitude, cannot be expressed by fractions.
128. There is therefore a sort of numbers, which cannot be
assigned by fractions, but which are nevertheless determinate
quantities; as, for instance, the square root of 12: and we
call this new species of numbers, irrational numbers. They
occur whenever we endeavour to find the square root of a
number which is not a square ; thus, 2 not being a perfect
sqviare, the square root of 2, or the number which, multiplied
by itself, would produce 2, is an irrational quantity. These
numbers are also called surd quantities, or incommensurahles.
129. These irrational quantities, though they cannot be
expressed ])y fractions, are nevertheless magnitudes of which
we may form an accurate idea; since, however concealed
