### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 12. "Of Square Roots, and of Irrational Numbers resulting from them."

**123.** What we have said in the preceding chapter amounts
to this ; that the square root of a given number is that number whose square is equal to the given number; and that
we may put before those roots either the positive, or the
negative sign.

**124.** So that when a square number is given, provided
we retain in our memory a sufficient number of square numbers, it is easy to find its root.
If 196, for example, be the
given number, we know that its square root is 14.

Fractions, likewise, are easily managed in the same way.
It is evident, for example, that ⁵⁄₇
is the square root of ²⁵⁄₄₉;
to be convinced of which, we have only to take the square
root of the numerator and that of the denominator.

If the number proposed be a mixed number, as 12¼, we
reduce it to a single fraction, which, in this case, will be ⁴⁹⁄₄;
and from this we immediately perceive that ⁷⁄₂, or 3½, must
be the square root of 12¼.

**125.** But when the given number is not a square, as 12,
for example, it is not possible to extract its square root ; or
to find a number, which, multiplied by itself, will give the
product 12. We know, however, that the square root of 12
must be greater than 3, because 3 · 3 produces only 9;
and less than 4, because 4 · 4 produces 16, which is more
than 12; we know also, that this root is less than 3½, for we
have seen that the square of 3½, or ⁷⁄₂, is 12¼; and we may
approach still nearer to this root, by comparing it with 3⁷⁄₁₅;
for the square of 3⁷⁄₁₅, or of ⁵²⁄₁₅, is ²⁷⁰⁴⁄₂₂₅, or 12⁴⁄₂₂₅; so that this
fraction is still greater than the root required, though but very
little so, as the difference of the two squarcs is only ⁴⁄₂₂₅.

**126.** We may suppose that as 3½ and 3⁷⁄₁₅
are numbers
greater than the root of 12, it might be possible to add to 3
a fraction a little less than ⁷⁄₁₅, and precisely such, that the
square of the sum would be equal to 12.

Let us therefore try with 3³⁄₇, since ³⁄₇ is a little less than ⁷⁄₁₅.
Now 3³⁄₇ is equal to ²⁴⁄₇, the square of which is ⁵⁷⁶⁄₄₉, and consequently less
by ¹²⁄₄₉ than 12, which may be expressed by
⁵⁸⁸⁄₄₉. It is, therefore, proved that 3³⁄₇ is less, and that 3⁷⁄₁₅
is greater than the root required. Let us then try a number a little greater than
3³⁄₇, but yet less than 3⁷⁄₁₅; for example, 3⁵⁄₁₁; this number, which is equal to
³⁸⁄₁₁, has for its
square ¹⁴⁴⁴⁄₁₂₁; and by reducing 12 to this denominator, we
obtain ¹⁴⁵²⁄₁₂₁ which shows that 3⁵⁄₁₁ is still less than the root of
12, namely by ⁸⁄₁₂₁; let us therefore substitute for ⁵⁄₁₁ the fraction
⁶⁄₁₃, which is a little greater, and see what will be the result of
the comparison of the square of 3⁶⁄₁₃, with the proposed number 12.
Here the square of 3⁶⁄₁₃ is ²⁰²⁵⁄₁₆₉; and 12 reduced to
the same denominator is ²⁰²⁸⁄₁₆₉; so that 3⁶⁄₁₃ is still too small,
though only by ³⁄₁₆₉, whilst 3⁷⁄₁₅ has been found too great.

**127.** It is evident, therefore, that whatever fraction is
joined to 3, the square of that sum must always contain a
fraction, and can never be exactly equal to the integer 12.
Thus, although we know that the square root of 12 is greater
than 3⁶⁄₁₃, and less than 3⁷⁄₁₅, yet we are unable to assign an
intermediate fraction between these two, which, at the same
time, if added to 3, would express exactly the square root of
12; but notwithstanding this, we are not to assert that the
square root of 12 is absolutely and in itself indeterminate:
it only follows from what has been said, that this root, though
it necessarily has a determinate magnitude, cannot be expressed by fractions.

**128.** There is therefore a sort of numbers, which cannot be
assigned by fractions, but which are nevertheless determinate
quantities; as, for instance, the square root of 12: and we
call this new species of numbers, **irrational numbers**. They
occur whenever we endeavour to find the square root of a
number which is not a square; thus, 2 not being a perfect
square, the square root of 2, or the number which, multiplied
by itself, would produce 2, is an irrational quantity. These
numbers are also called surd quantities, or incommensurables.

**129.** These irrational quantities, though they cannot be
expressed by fractions, are nevertheless magnitudes of which
we may form an accurate idea; since, however concealed
the square root of 12, for example, may appear, we are not
ignorant that it must be a number, which, when multiplied
by itself, would exactly produce 12; and this property is
sufficient to give us an idea of the number, because it is in
our power to approximate towards its value continually.

**130.** As we are therefore sufficiently acquainted with
the nature of irrational numbers, under our present consideration,
a particular sign has been agreed on to express
the square roots of all numbers that are not perfect squares;
which sign is written thus √, and is read *square root*.
Thus, √12 represents the square root of 12, or the number
which, multiplied by itself, produces 12; and √2 represents
the square root of 2; √3 the square root of 3; √⅔ that of
⅔; and, in general, $$\surd a$$ represents the square root of the
number $$a$$. Whenever, therefore, we would express the
square root of a number, which is not a square, we need
only make use of the mark √ by placing it before the
number.

**131.** The explanation which we have given of irrational
numbers will readily enable us to apply to them the known
methods of calculation. For knowing that the square root
of 2, multiplied by itself, must produce 2; we know also,
that the multiplication of √2 by √2 must necessarily produce 2;
that, in the same manner, the multiplication of
√3 by √3 must give 3; that √5 by √5 makes 5; that √⅔
by √⅔ makes ⅔; and, in general, that $$\surd a$$ multiplied by $$\surd a$$
produces $$a$$.

**132.** But when it is required to multiply $$\surd a$$ by $$\surd b$$,
the product is $$\surd(ab)$$; for we have already shown, that if a square
has two or more factors, its root must be composed of the
roots of those factors; we therefore find the square root of
the product $$ab$$, which is $$\surd(ab)$$, by multiplying the square
root of $$a$$, or $$\surd a$$, by the square root of $$b$$, or $$\surd b$$; etc.
It is evident from this, that if $$b$$ were equal to $$a$$, we should
have $$\surd(aa)$$ for the product of $$\surd a$$ by $$\surd b$$. But $$\surd(aa)$$ is
evidently $$a$$, since $$aa$$ is the square of $$a$$.

**133.** In division, if it were required, for example, to
divide $$\surd a$$, by $$\surd b$$, we obtain $$\surd \frac{a}{b}$$;
and, in this instance,
the irrationality may vanish in the quotient. Thus, having
to divide √18 by √8, the quotient is √¹⁸⁄₈,
which is reduced to √⁹⁄₄, and consequently to ³⁄₂, because ⁹⁄₄
is the square of ³⁄₂.

**134.** When the number before which we have placed the
radical sign √ is itself a square, its root is expressed in the
usual way; thus, √4 is the same as 2; √9 is the same as
3; √36 the same as 6; and √12¼, the same as ⁷⁄₂, or 3½.
In these instances, the irrationality is only apparent, and
vanishes of course.

**135.** It is easy also to multiply irrational numbers by ordinary numbers;
thus, for example, 2 multiplied by √5
makes 2√5; and 3 times √2 makes 3√2. In the second
example, however, as 3 is equal to √9, we may also express
3 times √2 by √9 multiplied by √2, or by √18; also $$2\surd a$$
is the same as $$\surd(4a)$$, and $$3 \surd a$$ the same as $$\surd(9a)$$;
and, in general, $$b\surd a$$ has the same value as the square root of $$bba$$,
or $$\surd(bba)$$: whence we infer reciprocally, that when the number which
is preceded by the radical sign contains a square,
we may take the root of that square, and put it before the
sign, as we should do in writing $$b \surd a$$ instead of $$\surd(bba)$$.
After this, the following reductions will be easily understood:
and so on

**136.** Division is founded on the same principles; as

**137.** There is nothing in particular to be observed in addition and subtraction,
because we only connect the numbers
by the signs + and -: for example, √2 added to √3 is written
√2 + √3; and √3 subtracted from √5 is written
√5 - √3.

**138.** Wo may observe lastly, that in order to distinguish
the irrational numbers, we call all other numbers, both integral and fractional,
**rational numbers**; so that, whenever
we speak of rational numbers, we understand integers, or,
fractions.
