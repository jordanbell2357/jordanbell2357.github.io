<span class="art">623</span> An equation is said to be of the second degree, when
it contains the square, or the second power, of the unknown
quantity, without any of its higher powers; and an equation,
containing likewise the third power of the unknown
quantity, belongs to cubic equations, and its resolution requires particular rules.

<span class="art">624</span> There are, therefore, only three kinds of terms in
an equation of the second degree:

1. The terms in which the unknown quantity is not
found at all, or which is composed only of known numbers.
2. The terms in which we find only the first power of the
unknown quantity.
3. The terms which contain the square, or the second
power, of the unknown quantity.

So that $$x$$ representing an unknown quantity, and the
letters $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, $$d$$, etc. the known quantities, the terms of
the first kind will have the form $$a$$, the terms of the second
kind will have the form $$bx$$, and the terms of the third kind
will have the form $$cx^2$$.

<span class="art">625</span> We have already seen, how two or more terms of
the same kind may be united together, and considered as a
single term.

For example, we may consider the formula
$$ax^2 - bx^2 + cx^2$$ as a single term, representing it thus,
$$(a - b + c)x^2$$; since, in fact, $$(a - b + c)$$ is a known
quantity.

And also, when such terms are found on both sides of the
sign =, we have seen how they may be brought to one side,
and then reduced to a single term. Let us take, for example, the equation,

$$2x^2-3x+4=5x^2-8x+11;$$

we first subtract $$2x^2$$, and there remains

$$-3x+4=3x^2-8x+11;$$

then adding $$8x$$, we obtain,

$$5x+4=3x^2+11;$$

lastly, subtracting 11, there remains $$3x^2 = 5x - 7$$.

<span class="art">626</span> We may also bring all the terms to one side of the
sign =, so as to leave zero, or 0, on the other; but it must
be remembered, that when terms are transposed from one
side to the other, their signs must be changed.

Thus, the above equation will assume this form,
$$3x^2-5x+7 = 0$$; and, for this reason also, the following general
formula represents all equations of the second degree;

$$ax^2 \pm bx \pm c = 0;$$

in which the sign ± is read plus or minus, and indicates,
that such terms as it stands before may be sometimes
positive, and sometimes negative.

<span class="art">627</span> Whatever therefore be the original form of a quadratic equation,
it may always be reduced to this formula of
three terms. If we have, for example, the equation

$$\frac{ax+b}{cx+d} = \frac{ex+f}{gx+h}$$

we may, first, destroy the fractions; multiplying, for this
purpose, by $$cx+d$$, which gives

$$ax+b=\frac{cex^2+cfx+edx+fd}{gx+h},$$

then by $$gx+h$$, we have

$$agx^2+bgx+ahx+bh=cex^2+cfx+edx+fd,$$

which is an equation of the second degree, reducible to
the three following terms, which we shall transpose by arranging them in the usual manner

$$
\begin{Bmatrix}
ag\\
-ce
\end{Bmatrix}
x^2
+
\begin{Bmatrix}
+bg\\
+ah\\
-cf\\
-ed
\end{Bmatrix}
x
+
\begin{Bmatrix}
+bh\\
-fd
\end{Bmatrix}
=
0.
$$

We may exhibit this equation also in the following form,
which is still more clear

$$(ag-ce)x^2+(bg+ah-cf-ed)x+bh-fd=0.$$

<span class="art">628</span> Equations of the second degree, in which all the
three kinds of terms are found, are called complete, and the
resolution of them is attended with greater difficulties; for
which reason we shall first consider those, in which one of
the terms is wanting.

Now, if the term $$x^2$$ were not found in the equation, it
would not be a quadratic, but would belong to those of
which we have already treated; and if the term, which
contains only known numbers, were wanting, the equation
would have this form, $$ax^2 \pm bx = 0$$, which being divisible
by $$x$$, may be reduced to $$ax \pm b = 0$$, which is likewise a
simple equation, and belongs not to the present class.

<span class="art">629</span> But when the middle term, which contains the first
power of $$x$$, is wanting, the equation assumes this form,
$$ax^2 \pm c = 0$$, or $$ax^2 = c$$; as the sign of $$c$$ may be either
positive, or negative

We shall call such an equation a pure equation of the second
degree, and the resolution of it is attended with no difficulty;
for we have only to divide by $$a$$, which gives $$x^2 = \dfrac{c}{a}$$; and

$$x=\surd \frac{c}{a};$$

which means the equation is resolved.

<span class="art">630</span> But there are three cases to be considered here. In
the first, when $$\frac{c}{a}$$ is a square number (of which we can therefore really
assign the root) we obtain for the value of $$x$$ a
rational number, which maybe either integral, or fractional.
For example, the equation $$x^2=144$$, gives $$x = 12$$. And
$$x^2=\frac{9}{16}$$, gives $$x=\frac{3}{4}$$.

The second case is, when $$\frac{c}{a}$$ is not a square, in which case
we must therefore be contented with the sign $$\surd$$. If, for
example, $$x^2 = 12$$, we have $$x =\surd 12$$, the value of which
may be determined by approximation, as we have already
shown.

The third case is that, in which $$\frac{c}{a}$$ becomes a negative
number: the value of $$x$$ is then altogether impossible and
imaginary; and this result proves that the question, which
leads to such an equation, is in itself impossible.

<span class="art">631</span> We shall also observe, before proceeding farther,
that whenever it is required to extract the square root of a
number, that root, as we have already remarked, has always
two values, the one positive and the other negative. Suppose,
for example, we have the equation $$x^2 = 49$$, the value
of $$x$$ will be not only +7, but also -7, which is expressed
by $$x= \pm 7$$. So that all those questions admit of a double
answer; but it will be easily perceived that in several cases,
as those which relate to a certain number of men, the negative value cannot exist.

<span class="art">632</span> In such equations, also, as $$ax^2= bx$$, where the
known quantity $$c$$ is wanting, there may be two values of $$x$$,
though we find only one if we divide by $$x$$. In the equation
$$x^2=3x$$, for example, in which it is required to assign such
a value of $$x$$, that $$x^2$$ may become equal to $$3x$$, this is done by
supposing $$x = 3$$, a value which is found by dividing the
equation by $$x$$; but, beside this value, there is also another,
which is equally satisfactory, namely, $$x=0$$; for then
$$x^2=0$$, and $$3x= 0$$. Equations therefore of the second
degree, in general, admit of two solutions, whilst simple
equations admit only of one.

We shall now illustrate what we have said with regard to
pure equations of the second degree by some examples.

<span class="art">633</span> *Question 1.* Required a number, the half of which
multiplied by the third, may produce 24.

Let this number be $$x$$; then by the question $$\frac{1}{2}x$$,
multiplied by $$\frac{1}{3}x$$, must give 24; we shall therefore have the
equation $$\frac{1}{6}x^2 = 24$$.

Multiplying by 6, we have $$x^2 = 144$$; and the extraction
of the root gives $$x = \pm 12$$. We put ±; for if $$x=+12$$,
we have $$\frac{1}{2}x = 6$$, and $$\frac{1}{3}x = 4$$: now, the product of these
two numbers is 24; and if $$x = - 12$$, we have $$\frac{1}{2}x = -6$$,
and $$\frac{1}{3}x = -4$$, the product of which is likewise 24.

<span class="art">634</span> *Question 2.* Required a number such, that being increased by 5,
and diminished by 5, the product of the sum by the difference may be 96.

Let this number be $$x$$, then $$x+5$$, multiplied by $$x-5$$,
must give 96; whence results the equation,

$$x^2-25=96.$$

Adding 25, we have $$x^2= 121$$; and extracting the root,
we have $$x=11$$. Thus $$x + 5 = 16$$, also $$x - 5 = 6$$; and,
lastly, 6 ⋅ 16 = 98.

<span class="art">635</span> *Question 3.* Required a number such, that by
adding it to 10, and subtracting it from 10, the sum, multiplied by the difference,
will give 51.

Let $$x$$ be this number; then $$10+x$$, multiplied by $$10-x$$,
must make 51, so that $$100 - x^2 = 51$$. Adding $$x^2$$, and
subtracting 51, we have $$x^2 = 49$$, the square root of which
gives $$x = 7$$.

<span class="art">636</span> *Question 4.* Three persons, who had been playing,
leave off; the first, with as many times 1 crowns, as the
second has three crowns; and the second, with as many
times 17 crowns, as the third has 5 crowns. Farther, if we
multiply the money of the first by the money of the second,
and the money of the second by the money of the third,
and, lastly, the money of the third by that of the first, the
sum of these three products will be 3830⅔. How much
money has each?

Suppose that the first player has $$x$$ crowns; and since
he has as many times 7 crowns, as the second has 3 crowns,
we know that his money is to that of the second, in the ratio
of 7:3.

We shall therefore have 7:3 ∷ $$x$$:$$\frac{3}{7}x$$, the money of the
second player.

Also, as the money of the second player is to that of the
third in the ratio of 17:5, we shall have
17:5 ∷ $$\frac{3}{7}x$$:$$\frac{15}{119}x$$,
the money of the third player.

Multiplying $$x$$, or the money of the first player, by $$\frac{3}{7}x$$, the
money of the second, we have the product $$\frac{3}{7}x^2$$: then, $$\frac{3}{7}x$$, the
money of the second, multiplied by the money of the third,
or by $$\frac{15}{119}x$$, gives $$\frac{45}{833}x^2$$; and, lastly, the money of the third,
or $$\frac{15}{119}x$$, multiplied by $$x$$, or the money of the first, gives
$$\frac{15}{119}x^2$$. Now, the sum of these three products is

$$\frac{3}{7}x^2+\frac{45}{833}x^2+\frac{15}{119}x^2;$$

and reducing these fractions to the same
denominator, we find their sum $$\frac{507}{833}x^2$$, which must be equal
to the number 3830⅔.

We have therefore, $$\frac{507}{833}x^2 = 3830\frac{2}{3}$$.

So that $$\frac{1521}{833}x^2 = 11492$$, and $$1521x^2$$ being equal to
9572836, dividing by 1521, we have $$x^2 = \frac{9572836}{1521}$$;
and taking its root, we find $$x = \frac{3094}{39}$$. This fraction is reducible
to lower terms, if we divide by 13; so that $$x = \frac{283}{3} = 79 \frac{2}{3}$$;
and hence we conclude, that $$\frac{3}{7}x = 34$$, and $$\frac{15}{119}x=10$$.

The first player therefore has 79⅓ crowns, the second has
34 crowns, and the third 10 crowns.

*Remark.* This calculation may be performed in an easier
manner; namely, by taking the factors of the numbers which
present themselves, and attending chiefly to the squares of
those factors.

It is evident, that 507 = 3 ⋅ 169, and that 169 is the
square of 13; then, that 833 = 7 ⋅ 119, and 119 = 7 ⋅ 17: therefore

$$\frac{3 \cdot 169}{17 \cdot 49}x^2=3830\frac{2}{3},$$

and if we multiply by 3,
we have $$\frac{9 \cdot 169}{17 \cdot 49}x^2=11492$$.
Let us resolve this number also into its factors; and we readily perceive, that
the first is 4, that is to say, that 11492 = 4 ⋅ 2873;
farther, 2873 is divisible bv 17, so that 2873 = 17 ⋅ 169.
Consequently, our equation will assume the following form,

$$\frac{9 \cdot 169}{17 \cdot 49}x^2=4\cdot 17\cdot 169,$$

which, divided by 169, is reduced to

$$\frac{9}{17 \cdot 49}x^2=4\cdot 17;$$

multiplying also by 17 ⋅ 49,
and dividing by 9, we have

$$x^2=\frac{4 \cdot 289 \cdot 49}{9},$$

in which all
the factors are squares; whence we have, without any
further calculation, the root

$$x = \frac{2 \cdot 17\cdot 7}{3}=\frac{238}{3}=79\frac{1}{3},$$

as before.

<span class="art">637</span> *Question 5.* A company of merchants appoint a
factor at Archangel. Each of them contributes for the
trade, which they have in view, ten times as many crowns
as there are partners; and the profit of the factor is fixed at
twice as many crowns, per cent, as there are partners. Also,
if ¹⁄₁₀₀ part of his total gain be multiplied by 2²⁄₉, it will give
the number of partners. That number is required.

Let it be $$x$$; and since, each partner has contributed $$10x$$,
the whole capital is $$10x^2$$. Now, for every hundred crowns,
the factor gains $$2x$$, so that with the capital of $$10x^2$$ his profit
will be $$\frac{1}{5}x^3$$. The ¹⁄₁₀₀ part of his gain is
$$\frac{1}{500}x^3$$; multiplying
by 2²⁄₉, or by ²⁰⁄₉, we have $$\frac{20}{4500}x^3$$, or $$\frac{1}{225}x^3$$,
and this must be equal to the number of partners, or $$x$$.

We have, therefore, the equation $$\frac{1}{225}x^3 = x$$, or
$$x^3=225x$$; which appears, at first, to be of the third degree;
but as we may divide by $$x$$, it is reduced to the quadratic
$$x^2=225$$; whence $$x = 15$$.

So that there are fifteen partners, and each contributed 150 crowns.
