<span class="art">58</span> As we have seen that some numbers are divisible by
certain divisors, while others are not so; it will be proper,
in order that we may obtain a more particular knowledge of
numbers, that this difference should be carefully observed,
both by distinguishing the numbers that are divisible by
divisors from those which are not, and by considering the
remainder that is left in the division of the latter. For this
purpose let us examine the divisors;

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.

<span class="art">59</span> First let the divisor be 2; the numbers divisible by it
are, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, etc. which, it appears,
increase always by two. These numbers, as far as they can
be continued, are called **even numbers**. But there are other
numbers, namely

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, etc.

which are uniformly less or greater than the former by unity,
and which cannot be divided by 2, without the remainder 1;
these are called **odd numbers**.

The even numbers are all comprehended in the general
expression $$2a$$; for they are all obtained by successively
substituting for $$a$$ the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. and hence
it follows that the odd numbers are all comprehended in the
expression $$2a + 1$$, because $$2a + 1$$ is greater by unity than
the even number $$2a$$.

<span class="art">60</span> In the second place, let the number 3 be the divisor;
the numbers divisible by it are,

3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and so on;

which numbers may be represented by the expression $$3a$$;
for $$3a$$, divided by 3, gives the quotient a without a remainder.
All other numbers which we would divide by 3,
will give 1 or 2 for a remainder, and are consequently of
two kinds. Those which after the division leave the remainder 1, are,

1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, etc.

and are contained in the expression $$3a + 1$$; but the other
kind, where the numbers give the remainder 2, are,

2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, etc.

which may be generally represented by $$3a + 2$$; so that all
numbers may be expressed either by $$3a$$, or by $$3a + 1$$, or
by $$3a + 2$$.

<span class="art">61</span> Let us now suppose that 4 is the divisor under consideration;
then the numbers which it divides are,

4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.

which increase uniformly by 4, and are comprehended in
the expression $$4a$$. All other numbers, that is, those which
are not divisible by 4, may either leave the remainder 1, or
be greater than the former by 1; as,

1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, etc.

and consequently may be comprehended in the expression
$$4a+1$$: or they may give the remainder 2; as,

2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, etc.

and be expressed by $$4a+2$$; or, lastly, they may give the
remainder 3; as,

3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, etc.

and may then be represented by the expression $$4a+3$$.
All possible integer numbers are contained therefore in
one or other of these four expressions;

$$4a, \; 4a + 1, \; 4a+ 2, \; 4a + 3.$$

<span class="art">62</span> It is also nearly the same when the divisor is 5;
for all numbers which can be divided by it are comprehended in the expression
$$5a$$, and those which cannot be
divided by 5, are reducible to one of the following expressions:

$$5a+1, \; 5a+2, \; 5a + 3, \; 5a + 4;$$

and in the same manner ve may continue, and consider any
greater divisor.

<span class="art">63</span> It is here proper to recollect what has been already
said on the resolution of numbers into their simple factors;
for every number, among the factors of which is found
2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 7,
or any other number, will be divisible by those numbers.
For example; 60 being equal to 2 · 2 · 3 · 5, it is
evident that 60 is divisible by 2, and by 3, and by 5.

<span class="art">64</span> Farther, as the general expression $$abcd$$ is not only
divisible by $$a$$, and $$b$$, and $$c$$, and $$d$$, but also by

$$ab$$, $$ac$$, $$ad$$, $$bc$$, $$bd$$, $$cd$$ and by  
$$abc$$, $$abd$$, $$acd$$, $$bcd$$, and lastly by  
$$abcd$$, that is to say, its own value;

it follows that 60, or 2 · 2 · 3 · 5, may be divided not
only by these simple numbers, but also by those which are
composed of any two of three; that is to say, by 4, 6, 10,
15: and also by those which are composed of any three of
its simple factors; that is to say, by 12, 20, 30, and lastly
also, by 60 itself.

<span class="art">65</span> When, therefore, we have represented any number,
assumed at pleasure, by its simple factors, it will be very
easy to exhibit all the numbers by which it is divisible.
For we have only, first, to take the simple factors one by
one, and then to multiply them together two by two,
three by three, four by four, etc. till we arrive at the number
proposed.

<span class="art">66</span> It must here be particularly observed, that every
number is divisible by 1; and also, that every number is
divisible by itself; so that every number has at least two
factors, or divisors, the number itself, and unity: but every
number which has no other divisor than these two, belongs
to the class of numbers, which we have before called simple,
or prime numbers.

Except these simple numbers, all other numbers have,
beside unity and themselves, other divisors, as may be seen
from the following Table, in which are placed under each
number all its divisors.

<span class="art">67</span> Lastly, it ought to be observed that 0, or nothing;
may be considered as a number which has the property of
being divisible by all possible numbers; because by whatever number
$$a$$ we divide 0, the quotient is always 0; for it
must be remarked, that the multiplication of any number
by nothing produces nothing, and therefore 0 times $$a$$, or
$$0a$$, is 0.
