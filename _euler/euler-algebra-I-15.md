### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 15. "Of Cube Roots, and of Irrational Numbers resulting from them."

**158.** As we can, in the manner already explained, find
the cube of a given number, so, when a number is proposed,
we may also reciprocally find a number, which, multiplied
twice by itself, will produce that number. The number
here sought is called, with relation to the other, the **cube
root**; so that the cube root of a given number is the number
whose cube is equal to that given number.

**159.** It is easy therefore to determine the cube root, when
the number proposed is a real cube, such as in the examples
in the last chapter; for we easily perceive that the cube root
of 1 is 1; that of 8 is 2; that of 27 is 3; that of 64 is 4,
and so on. And, in the same manner, the cube root of -27
is -3; and that of -125 is -5.

Farther, if the proposed number be a fraction, as ⁸⁄₂₇, the
cube root of it must be ⅔7; and that of ⁶⁴⁄₃₄₃ is ⁴⁄₇. Lastly,
the cube root of a mixed number, such as 2¹⁰⁄₂₇ must be ⁴⁄₃,
or 1⅓; because 2¹⁰⁄₂₇ is equal to ⁶⁴⁄₂₇.

**160.** But if the proposed number be not a cube, its cube
root cannot be expressed either in integers, or in fractional
numbers. For example, 43 is not a cubic number; therefore it is
impossible to assign any number, either integer or
fractional, whose cube shall be exactly 43.
We may however affirm, that the cube root of that number is greater
than 3, since the cube of 3 is only 27; and less than 4,
because the cube of 4 is 64: we know, therefore, that the
cube root required is necessarily contained between the
numbers 3 and 4.

**161.** Since the cube root of 43 is greater than 3, if we
add a fraction to 3, it is certain that we may approximate
still nearer and nearer to the true value of this root: but we
can never assign the number which expresses the value exactly;
because the cube of a mixed number can never be
perfectly equal to an integer, such as 43. If we were to
suppose, for example, 3⅓, or ⁷⁄₂ to be the cube root required,
the error would be ⅛; for the cube of ⁷⁄₂ is only ³⁴³⁄₈, or
42⅞.

**162.** This therefore shows, that the cube root of 43 cannot be
expressed in any way, either by integers or by fractions. However, we
have a distinct idea of the magnitude of this root; and therefore we use,
in order to represent it,
the sign ∛, which we place before the proposed number,
and which is read *cube root*, to distinguish it from the square
root, which is often called simply the root; thus ∛43 means
the cube root of 43; that is to say, the number whose cube
is 43, or which, multiplied by itself, and then by itself again,
produces 43.

**163.** Now, it is evident that such expressions cannot
belong to rational quantities, but that they rather form a
particular species of irrational quantities. They have nothing in common with
square roots, and it is not possible
to express such a cube root by a square root; as, for example, by √12;
for the square of √12 being 12, its cube
will be 12√12, consequently still irrational, and therefore it
cannot be equal to 43.

**164.** If the proposed number be a real cube, our expressions become rational.
Thus, ∛l is equal to 1; ∛8 is
equal to 2; ∛27 is equal to 3; and, generally, $$\surd[3] aaa is equal
to a.

165. If it were proposed to multiply one cube root, ^/a,
by another, l/b, the product must be \/ah ; for we know that
