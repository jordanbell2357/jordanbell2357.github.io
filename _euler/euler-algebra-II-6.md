<span class="art">79</span> We have already shwn, <span class="artref">Art. 63</span>, how such formulae
as $$a+bx+cx^2$$ are to be transformed, in order that the
second term may be destroyed  we shall therefore confine
our present inquiries to the formula $$ax^2 + b$$, in which it is
required to find for $$x$$ only integer numbers, which may
transform that formula into a square. Now, first of all,
such a formula must be possible; for, if it be not, we shall
not even obtain fractional values of $$x$$, far less integer ones.

<span class="art">80</span> Let us suppose then $$ax^2+b=y^2$$; $$a$$ and $$b$$ being
integer numbers, as well as $$x$$ and $$y$$.

Now, here it is absolutely necessary for us to know, or to
have already found a case in integer numbers; otherwise it
would be lost labor to seek for other similar cases, as the
formula might happen to be impossible.

We shall, therefore, suppose that this formula becomes a
square, by making $$x-f$$, and we shall represent that square
by $$g^2$$, so that $$af^2+b=g^2$$, where $$f$$ and $$g$$ are known
numbers. Then we have only to deduce from this case other similar
cases; and this inquiry is so much the more important,
as it is subject to considerable difficulties; which,
however, we shall be able to surmount by particular artifices.
