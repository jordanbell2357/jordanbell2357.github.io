<span class="art">23</span> When there are two or more equal numbers to be
added together, the expression of their sum may be abridged:
for example,

$$a + a$$ is the same with $$2 \cdot a$$,

$$a+a+a$$ is the same with $$3 \cdot a$$,

$$a+a+a+a$$ is the same with $$4 \cdot a$$, and so on.

In this manner we may form an idea
of multiplication; and it is to be observed that,

$$2 \cdot a$$ signifies 2 times $$a$$

$$3 \cdot a$$ signifies 3 times $$a$$

$$4 \cdot a$$ signifies 4 times $$a$$, etc.

<span class="art">24</span> If therefore a number expressed by a letter is to be
multiplied by any other number, we simply put that number
before the letter, thus;

$$a$$ multiplied by 20 is expressed by $$20a$$, and

$$b$$ multiplied by 30 is expressed by $$30b$$, etc.

It is evident, also, that $$c$$ taken once, or $$1c$$, is the same as $$c$$.

<span class="art">25</span> Farther, it is extremely easy to multiply such products again by other numbers; for example:

2 times $$3a$$, makes $$6a$$

3 times $$4b$$, makes $$12b$$

5 times $$7x$$ makes $$35x$$,

and these products may be still multiplied by other numbers
at pleasure.

<span class="art">26</span> When the number by which we are to multiply is
also represented by a letter, we place it immediately before
the other letter; thus, in multiplying $$b$$ by $$a$$, the product is
written $$ab$$; and $$pq$$ will be the product of the multiplication
of the number $$q$$ by $$p$$. Also, if we multiply this $$pq$$ again
by $$a$$, we shall obtain $$apq$$.

<span class="art">27</span> It may be farther remarked here, that the order in
which the letters are joined together is indifferent; thus $$ab$$
is the same thing as $$ba$$; for $$b$$ multiplied by $$a$$ is the same
as $$a$$ multiplied by $$b$$. To understand this, we have only to
substitute, for $$a$$ and $$b$$, known numbers, as 3 and 4; and
the truth will be self-evident; for 3 times 4 is the same as
4 times 3.

<span class="art">28</span> It will not be difficult to perceive, that when we substitute numbers
for letters joined together, in the manner we
have described, they cannot be written in the same way by
putting them one after the other. For if we were to write
34 for 3 times 4, we should have 34 and not 12. When
therefore it is required to multiply common numbers, we
must separate them by a point: thus,
3 ⋅ 4, signifies 3 times 4; that is, 12.
So, 1 ⋅ 2 is equal to 2; and 1 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 makes 6. In like manner,
1 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 6 makes 1344;
and 1 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 6 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 9 ⋅ 10 is equal to 3628800, etc.

<span class="art">29</span> In the same manner we may discover the value of an
expression of this form, $$5 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot abcd$$.
It shows that 5 must
be multiplied by 7, and that this product is to be again
multiplied by 8; that we are then to multiply this product
of the three numbers by $$a$$, next by $$b$$, then by $$c$$, and lastly
by $$d$$. It may be observed, also, that instead of 5 ⋅ 7 ⋅8, we
may write its value, 280; for we obtain this number when
we multiply the product of 5 by 7, or 35, by 8.

<span class="art">30</span> The results which arise from the multiplication of
two or more numbers are called **products**; and the numbers,
or individual letters, are call **factors**.

<span class="art">31</span> Hitherto we have considered only positive numbers,
and there can be no doubt, but that the products which we
have seen arise are positive also: namely $$+a$$ by $$+b$$ must
necessarily give $$+ab$$. But we must separately examine
what the multiplication of $$+a$$ by $$-b$$, and of $$-a$$ by $$-b$$,
will produce.

<span class="art">32</span> Let us begin by multiplying $$-a$$ by 3 or +3. Now,
since $$-a$$ may be considered as a debt, it is evident that if
we take that debt three times, it must thus become three
times greater, and consequently the required product is
$$-3a$$. So if we multiply $$-a$$ by $$+b$$, we shall obtain $$-ba$$,
or, which is the same thing, $$-ab$$. Hence we conclude,
that if a positive quantity be multiplied by a negative quantity,
the product will be negative; and it may be laid down
as a rule, that + by + makes + or plus; and that, on the
contrary, + by - , or - by +, gives -, or minus.

<span class="art">33</span> It remams to resolve the case in which - is multiplied by -;
or, for example, $$-a$$ by $$-b$$. It is evident,
at first sight, with regard to the letters, that the product will
be $$ab$$; but it is doubtful whether the sign +, or the sign -,
is to be placed before it; all we know is, that it must be one
or the other of these signs. Now, I say that it cannot be
the sign -: for $$-a$$ by $$+b$$ gives $$-ab$$, and $$-a$$ by $$-b$$
cannot produce the same result as $$-a$$ by $$+b$$ but must produce a contrary result,
that is to say, $$+ab$$; consequently, we have the following rule: - multiplied by - produces
+, that is, the same as + multiplied by +.

<span class="art">34</span> The rules which we have explained are expressed
more briefly as follows:

Like signs, multiplied together, give +; unlike or contrary signs give -.
Thus, when it is required to multiply
the following numbers; $$+a$$, $$-b$$, $$-c$$, $$+d$$; we have first
$$+a$$ multiplied by $$-b$$, which makes $$-ab$$; this by $$-c$$,
gives $$+abc$$; and this by $$+d$$, gives $$+abcd$$.

<span class="art">35</span> The difficulties with respect to the signs being removed,
we have only to show how to multiply numbers that
are themselves products. If we were, for instance,
to multiply the number $$ab$$ by the number $$cd$$,
the product would be $$abcd$$, and it is obtained by multiplying first $$ab$$ by $$c$$, and
then the result of that multiplication by $$d$$. Or, if we had
to multiply 36 by 12; since 12 is equal to 3 times 4, we
should only multiply 36 first by 3, and then the product
108 by 4, in order to have the whole product of the multiplication of 12 by 36,
which is consequently 432.

<span class="art">36</span> But if we wished to multiply $$5ab$$ by $$3cd$$, we might
write $$3cd 5ab$$. However, as in the present instance the
order of the numbers to be multiplied is indifferent, it will
be better, as is also the custom, to place the common numbers before the letters,
and to express the product thus: $$5 \cdot 3 abcd$$, or $$15abcd$$; since 5 times 3 is 15.

So if we had to multiply $$12pqr$$ by $$7xy$$, we should obtain
$$12\cdot 7pqrxy$$, or $$84pqrxy$$.
