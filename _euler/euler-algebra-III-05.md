425 The summation of arithmetical progressions, which
begin by 1, and the difference of which is 1, 2, 3, or any
Other integer, leads to the theory of polygonal numbers,
which are formed by adding together the terms of any such
progression.


426. Suppose the difference to be 1 ; then, since the first
term is 1 also, we shall have the arithmetical progression, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, &c. and if in this progression we take the sum of one, of two, of three, Sec. terms,
the following series of numbers will arise :

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, &c.

for 1 = 1, 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, etc.

Which nuiribers are called triangidar, or trigonal numbers, because we may always arrange as many points in the
form of a triangle as they contain units, thus

13 6 10 15

427. In all these triangles, we see how many points
each side contains. In the first triangle there is only one
point ; in the second there are two ; in the third there are
three ; in the fourth there are four, &c. : so that the triangular numbers, or the number of points, which is simply
called the triangle, are arranged according to the number of
points which the side contains, which number is called the
side; that is, the third triangular number, or the third
triangle, is that whose side has three points; the fourth,
that whose side has four ; and so on ; which may be represented thus:




428. A question therefore presents itself here, whicli is,
how to determine the triangle when the side is given .? and,
after what has been said, this may be easily resolved.

For if the side be $$n$$, the triangle will be 1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ + $$n$$.
Now, the sum ol this progression is $$\dfrac{n^2+n}{2}$$;
consequently
the value of the triangle is $$\dfrac{n^2+n}{2}$$.

Thus



and so on : and when n = 100, the triangle will be 5050.


429. This formula


is called the general formula of
triangular numbers; because by it we find the triangular
number, or the triangle, which answers to any side indicated
by n.


This may be transformed into



which serves also
to facilitate the calculation ; since one of the two numbers n,
or w-{- 1, must always be an even number, and consequently
divisible by 2.


So, if w = 12, the triangle is




430. Let us now suppose the difference to be 2, and we
sliall have the following arithmetical progression

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21

the sums of which, taking successively one, two, three, four
terms, &c. form the tbllowing series

1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, &c.

the terms of which are called quadrangnlar numbers, or
squares; since they represent the squares of the natural
numbers, as we have already seen ; and this denomination
is the more suitable from this circumstance, that we can
always form a square with the number of points which those
terms indicate, thus



431. We see here, that the side of any square contains
precisely the number of points which the square root indicates. 'Ihus, for example, the side of the square 16 consists of 4 points ; that of the square 25 consists of 5 points
;
and, in general, if the side be n, that is, if the number of the
terms of the progression, 1, 3, 5, 7, &c. which we have
taken, be expressed by w, the square, or the quadrangular
number, will be equal to the sum of those terms ; that is to
n^i as we have already seen. Article 422; but it is unnecessary to extend our consideration of square numbers any
farther, having already treated of them at length.


432. If now we call the difference 3, and take the sums
in the same manner as before, we obtain numbers which are
called pentagons, or pentagonal numbers, though they cannot be so well represented by points


the indices shewino- the side of each pentat^^on.


433. It follows from this, that if we make the side w, the


Let, for example, n = 7, the pentagon will be 70 ; and if
the pentagon, whose side is 100, be required, we make n =
100, and obtain 14950 for the number sought.


434. If Ave suppose the difference to be 4, we arrive at
hexagonal numbers, as we see by the following progressions

where the indices still shew the side of each hexagon.

435. So that when the side is 7i, the hexagonal number is
2;r — n = n{^ti — 1) ; and we have farther to remark, that
all the hexagonal numbers are also triangular ; since, if we
take of these last the first, the third, the fifth, &c. we have
precisely the series of hexagons.


436. In the same manner, we may find the numbers
which are hcptagonal, octagonal, &c. It will be sufficient
therefore to exhibit the following Table of formula? for all
numbers that are comprehended under the general name of
polygonal numbers.


Supposing the side to be represented by w, we have
for the




437. So that the side being ti, the w-gonal number Avi]l
, , ,
(»^-2)/^*— (m-4)n ,
be represented by ^ ; whence we may deduce all the possible polygonal numbers which have the side
n. Thus, for example, if the bigonal numbers were required, we should have w = 2, and consequently the number
sought = n ; that is to say, the bigonal numbers are the
natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, &c.*


If we make 771 = 3, we have —^— for the triangular number required.

If we make m = 4, we have the square number ;/*, &c.


438. To illustrate this rule by examples, suppose that
the xxv-gonal number, whose side is 36, were required ; we
look first in the Table for the xxv-gonal number, wliose
side IS w, and it is round to be . Ihen makinsr n
= 36, we find 14526 for the number sought.


439. Question. A person bought a house, and he is
asked how much he paid for it. He answers, that the 365""
gonal number of 12 is the number of crowns which it cost
him.

In order to find this number, we make in — 365, and
n = 12 ; and substituting these values in the general formula,
we find for the price of the house 23970 crowns *
