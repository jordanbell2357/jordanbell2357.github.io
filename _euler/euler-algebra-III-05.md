440. The Geometrical ratio of two numbers is found by
resolving the question, How many times is one of those
numbers greater than the other? This is done by dividing
one by the other; and the quotient will express the ratio
required.

441. We have here three things to consider; 1st, the
first of the two given numbers, which is called the antecedent;
2dly, the other number, which is called the consequent
;
3dly, the ratio of the two numbers, or the quotient arising
from the divisioa of the antecedent by the consequent. For
example, if the relation of the numbers 18 and 12 be required, 18 is the antecedent^ 12 is the consequent, and the
ratio will be '^ =^ ^1 ; whence we see that the antecedent
contains the consequent once and a half.

442. It is usual to represent geometrical relation by two
points, placed one above the other, between the antecedent
and the consequent. Thus, a : h means the geometrical
relation of these two numbers, or the ratio of a to h.
We have already remarked that this sign is employed to
represent division *, and for this reason we make use of it
here ; because, in order to know the ratio, we must divide
a by 6; the relation expressed by this sign being read
simply, a is to h.

443. Relation therefore is expressed by a fraction, whose
numerator is the antecedent, and whose denominator is the
consequent ; but perspicuity requires that this fraction
should be always reduced to its lowest terms : which is
done, as we have already shewn, by dividing both the
numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Thus, the fraction W becomes |, by dividing both
terms by 6
