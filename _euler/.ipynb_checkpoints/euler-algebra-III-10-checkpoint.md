#### Section III. "Of Ratios and Proportions." Chapter 10. "Of Compound Relations."

<span class="art">488</span> Compound Relations are obtained by multiplying
the terms of two or more relations, the antecedents by the
antecedents, and the consequents by the consequents; we
then say, that the relation between those two products is
compounded of the relations given.

Thus the relations $$a : b$$, $$c : d$$, $$e : f$$ give the compound
relation $$ace : bdf$$.

<span class="art">489</span> A relation continuing always the same, when we
divide both its terms by the same number, in order to
abridge it, we may greatly facilitate the above composition
by comparing the antecedents and the consequents, for the
purpose of making such reductions as we performed in the
last chapter.

For example, we find the compound relation of the following given relations thus:

Relations given 12 : 25, 28 : 33, and 55 : 56.

Which becomes

(12·28·55) : (25·33·56) = 2 : 5

by cancelling the common divisors.

So that 2 : 5 is the compound relation required.

<span class="art">490</span> The same operation is to be performed, when it is
required to calculate generally by letters; and the most remarkable case is that in which each antecedent is equal to
the consequent of the preceding relation. If the given relations are
