<span class="art">68</span> When a number, as 7, for instance, is said not to be
divisible by another number, let us suppose by 3, this only
means, that the quotient cannot be expressed by an integer
number; but it must not by any means be thought that it
is impossible to form an idea of that quotient. Only
imagine a line of 7 feet in length; nobody can doubt the
possibility of dividing this line into 3 equal parts, and of
forming a notion of the length of one of those parts.

<span class="art">69</span> Since therefore we may form a precise idea of the
quotient obtained in similar cases, though that quotient may
not be an integer number, this leads us to consider a particular species of numbers,
called fractions, or broken numbers; of which the instance adduced furnishes an illustration.
For if we have to divide 7 by 3, we easily conceive the
quotient which should result, and express it by $$\frac{7}{3}$$; placing
the divisor under the dividend, and separating the two
numbers by a stroke, or line.

<span class="art">70</span> So, in general, when the number $$a$$ is to be divided by
the number $$b$$, we represent the quotient by $$\frac{a}{b}$$, and call
this form of expression a **fraction**. We cannot therefore
give a better idea of a fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$, than by saying that it expresses
the quotient resulting from the division of the upper
number by the lower. We must remember also, that in all
fractions the lower number is called the denominator, and
that above the line the numerator.

<span class="art">71</span> In the above fraction $$\frac{7}{3}$$, which we read seven thirds,
7 is the numerator, and 3 the denominator. We must also
read $$\frac{2}{3}$$, two thirds; $$\frac{3}{4}$$, three fourths;
$$\frac{3}{8}$$, three eighths; $$\frac{12}{100}$$,
twelve hundredths; and $$\frac{1}{2}$$, one half, etc.

<span class="art">72</span> In order to obtain a more perfect knowledge of the
nature of fractions, we shall begin by considering the case
in which the numerator is equal to the denominator, as in
$$\frac{a}{a}$$. Now, since this expresses the quotient obtained by
dividing $$a$$ by $$a$$, it is evident that this quotient is exactly
unity, and that consequently the fraction $$\frac{a}{a}$$ is of the same
value as 1, or one integer; for the same reason, all the following fractions,

$$\frac{2}{2}, \frac{3}{3}, \frac{4}{4}, \frac{5}{5}, \frac{6}{6}, \frac{7}{7}, \frac{8}{8}, \textrm{etc.}$$

are equal to one another, each being equal to 1, or one whole.[^1]

[^1]: With changes by me to Hewlett's English translation, using the German text from the *Leonhardi Euleri Opera omnia*. In particular, "one integer" in the English text corresponds to "ein Gantzes" in the German text, which is properly translated "one whole". (The English translation is through the French translation, and the French "entier" means both "integer" and "whole".)

<span class="art">73</span> We have seen that a fraction whose numerator is
equal to the denominator, is equal to unity. All fractions
therefore whose numerators are less than the denominators,
have a value less than unity; for if I have a number to
divide by another, which is greater than itself, the result
must necessarily be less than 1. If we cut a line, for example, two feet long,
into three parts, one of those parts will
undoubtedly be shorter than a foot: it is evident then, that
⅔ is less than 1, for the same reason; that is, the numerator
2 is less than the denominator 3.

<span class="art">74</span> If the numerator, on the contrary, be greater than the
denominator, the value of the fraction is greater than unity.
Thus ³⁄₂ is greater than 1, for ³⁄₂ is equal to ²⁄₂ together with ½.
Now ²⁄₂ is exactly 1; consequently ³⁄₂ is equal to 1 + ½, that
is, to an integer and a half. In the same manner, ⁴⁄₃ is equal
to 1⅓, ⁵⁄₃ to 1⅔, and ⁷⁄₃ to 2⅓. And, in general, it is sufficient
in such cases to divide the upper number by the lower, and
to add to the quotient a fraction, having the remainder for
the numerator, and the divisor for the denominator. If the
given fraction, for example, were ⁴³⁄₁₂, we should have for the
quotient 3, and 7 for the remainder; whence we should
conclude that ⁴³⁄₁₂ is the same as 3⁷⁄₁₂.

<span class="art">75</span> Thus we see how fractions, whose numerators are
greater than the denominators, are resolved into two members;
one of which is an integer, and the other a fractional
number, having the numerator less than the denominator.
Such fractions as contain one or more integers, are called
**improper fractions**. On the other hand, **proper fractions** are those
whose numerator is less than its
denominator, and whose value is consequently less than unity, or than a whole.

<span class="art">76</span> The nature of fractions is frequently considered in
another way, which may throw additional light on the subject.
If, for example, we consider the fraction ¾, it is evident
that it is three times greater than ¼. Now, this fraction ¼
means, that if we divide 1 into 4 equal parts, this will be the
value of one of those parts; it is obvious then, that by
taking 3 of those parts we shall have the value of the
fraction 1.

In the same manner we may consider every other fraction;
for example, ⁷⁄₁₂; if we divide unity into 12 equal parts, 7 of
those parts will be equal to the fraction proposed.

<span class="art">77</span> From this manner of considering fractions, the expressions numerator
and denominator are derived.
For, as in the preceding fraction ⁷⁄₁₂ the number under the line
shows that 12 is the number of parts into which unity is to
be divided; and as it may be said to denote, or name, the
parts, it has not improperly been called the **denominator**.

Farther, as the upper number, namely 7, shows that, in order
to have the value of the fraction, we must take, or collect, 7
of those parts, and therefore may be said to reckon or number them, it has been thought
proper to call the number
above the line the **numerator**.

<span class="art">78</span> As it is easy to understand what ¾ is, when we know
the signification of ¼, we may consider the fractions whose
numerator is unity, as the foundation of all others. Such
are the fractions,

½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙, ⅐, ⅛, ⅑, ⅒, ¹⁄₁₁, ¹⁄₁₂, etc.

and it is observable that these fractions go on continually
diminishing: for the more you divide an integer, or the
greater the number ofparts into which you distribute it, the less
does each of those parts become. Thus, ¹⁄₁₀₀ is less than ⅒;
¹⁄₁₀₀₀ is less than ¹⁄₁₀₀; and ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀ is less than -¹⁄₁₀₀₀, etc.

<span class="art">79</span> As we have seen that the more we increase the denominator of such
fractions the less their values become, it
may be asked, whether it is not possible to make the denominator so great
that the fraction shall be reduced to
nothing? I answer, no; for into whatever number of parts
unity (the length of a foot, for instance) is divided; let
those parts be ever so small, they will still preserve a certain
magnitude, and therefore can never be absolutely reduced
to nothing.

<span class="art">80</span> It is true, if we divide the length of a foot into 1000
parts, those parts will not easily fall under the cognisance of
our senses; but view them through a good microscope, and
each of them will appear large enough to be still subdivided
into 100 parts, and more.

At present, however, we have nothing to do with what
depends on ourselves, or with what we are really capable of
performing, and what our eyes can perceive; the question
is rather what is possible in itself: and, in this sense, it is
certain, that however great we suppose the denominator, the
fraction will never entirely vanish, or become equal to 0.

<span class="art">81</span> We can never therefore arrive completely at 0, or
nothing, however great the denominator may be; and, consequently,
as those fractions must always preserve a certain quantity,
we may continue the series of fractions in
<span class="artref">Art. 78</span> without interruption. This circumstance has introduced
the expression, that the denominator must be infinite, or infinitely great,
in order that the fraction may be
reduced to 0, or to nothing; hence the word infinite in
reality signifies here, that we can never arrive at the end of
the series of the above-mentioned fractions.

<span class="art">82</span> To express this idea, according to the sense of it
above-mentioned, we make use of the sign ∞, which consequently indicates a
number infinitely great; and we may
therefore say, that this fraction $$\frac{1}{\infty}$$ is in reality nothing;
because a fraction cannot be reduced to nothing, until the
denominator has been increased to infinity.

<span class="art">83</span> It is the more necessary to pay attention to this idea of
infinity, as it is derived from the first elements of our knowledge,
and as it will be of the greatest importance in the
following part of this treatise.

We may here deduce from it a few consequences that are
extremely curious, and worthy of attention. The fraction $$\frac{1}{\infty}$$
represents the quotient resulting from the division of the
dividend 1 by the divisor ∞. Now, we know, that if we
divide the dividend 1 by the quotient $$\frac{1}{\infty}$$, which is equal to
nothing, we obtain again the divisor ∞: hence we acquire
a new idea of infinity; and learn that it arises from the
division of 1 by 0; so that we are thence authorised in
saying, that 1 divided by 0 expresses a number infinitely
great, or ∞.

<span class="art">84</span> It may be necessary also, in this place, to correct the
mistake of those who assert, that a number infinitely great
is not susceptible of increase. This opinion is inconsistent
with the just principles which we have laid down; for $$\frac{1}{0}$$
signifying a number infinitely great, and $$\frac{2}{0}$$ being incontestably
the double of $$\frac{1}{0}$$, it is evident that a number, though
infinitely great, may still become twice, thrice, or any number of times greater
