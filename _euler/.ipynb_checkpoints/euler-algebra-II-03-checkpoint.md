### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section II. "Of the different Methods of calculating Compound Quantities." Chapter 3. "Of the Multiplication of Simple Quantities."

**270.** When it is only required to represent multiplication, we put each of the
expressions, that are to be multiplied together, within two parentheses, and join them to each other, sometimes without any sign, and sometimes placing a point ⋅ between them.

Thus, for example, to represent the product of the two expressions $$a-b+c$$
and $$d-e+f$$ we write

$$(a-b+c) \cdot (d-e+f)$$

or barely,

$$(a - b + c) (d-e+f)$$

which method of expressing products is much used, because it immediately exhibits
the factors of which they are composed.

**271.** But in order to show how multiplication is actually performed, we may remark,
in the first place, that to multiply, for example, a quantity, such
as $$a-b+c$$, by 2, each term of it is separately multiplied by that number;
so that the product is

$$2a-2b+2c.$$

And the same thing takes place with regard to all other
numbers; for if $$d$$ were the number by which it was required
to multiply the same expression, we should obtain

$$ad-bd+cd.$$

**272.** In the last article, we have supposed $$d$$ to be a
positive number; but if the multiplier were a negative number,
as -e, the rule formerly given must be applied; namely,
that unlike signs multiplied together produce -, and like
signs +. Thus we should have

$$-ae+be-ce.$$

**273.** Now, in order to show how a quantity, $$A$$, is to be
multiplied by a compound quantity, d-e; let us first consider an example in numbers, supposing that $$A$$ is to be multiplied by 7 - 3. Here it is evident, that we are required
to take the quadruple of $$A$$: for if we first take $$A$$ seven
times, it will then be necessary to subtract $$3A$$ from that
product.

In general, therefore, if it be required to multiply $$A$$
by $$d-e$$, we multiply the quantity $$A$$ first by $$d$$,
and then by $$e$$, and subtract this last product from the
first: whence results $$dA-eA$$.

If we now suppose that $$A=a-b$$, and that this is the quantity
to be multiplied by $$d-e$$; we shall have

$$
\begin{gather}
dA=ad-bd\\
eA=ae-be
\end{gather}
$$

whence $$dA-cA=ad-bd-ae+be$$ is the product required.

**274.** Since therefore we know accurately the product
$$(a-b)\cdot (d-e)$$, we shall now exhibit the same example
of multiplication under the following form:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
a&-b&&\\
d&-e&&\\
\hline
ad&-bd&-ae&+be.
\end{array}
$$

Which shows, that we must multiply each term of the upper
expression by each term of the lower, and that, with regard
to the signs, we must strictly observe the rule before given;
a rule which this circumstance would completely confirm, if
it admitted of the least doubt.
