<span class="art">180</span> We have nothing particular to observe with regard
to the Addition and Subtraction of powers; for we only
represent those operations by means of the signs + and -,
when the powers are different. For example, $$a^3 + a^2$$ is the
sum of the second and third powers of $$a$$; and $$a^5 - a^4$$ is
what remains when we subtract the fourth power of $$a$$ from
the fifth; and neither of these results can be abridged: but
when we have powers of the same kind or degree, it is
evidently unnecessary to connect them by signs; as $$a^3+a^3$$
becomes $$2a^3$$, etc.

<span class="art">181</span> But in the Multiplication of powers, several circumstances require attention.

First, when it is required to multiply any power of $$a$$ by
$$a$$, we obtain the succeeding power; that is to say, the power
whose exponent is greater by a unit. Thus, $$a^2$$ multiplied
by $$a$$, produces $$a^3$$; and $$a^3$$, multiplied by $$a$$, produces $$a^4$$.
In the same manner, when it is required to multiply by a
the powers of any number represented by $$a$$, having negative
exponents, we have only to add 1 to the exponent. Thus,
$$a^{-1}$$ multiplied by $$a$$ produces $$a^0$$, or 1; which is made more
evident by considering that $$a^{-1}$$ is equal to $$\frac{1}{a}$$, and that the
product of $$\frac{1}{a}$$ by $$a$$ being $$\frac{a}{a}$$, it is consequently equal to 1;
likewise $$a^{-2}$$ multiplied by $$a$$, produces $$a^{-1}$$, or $$\frac{1}{a}$$; and
$$a^{-10}$$ multiplied by $$a$$, gives $$a^{-9}$$, and so on.

<span class="art">182</span> Next, if it be required to multiply any power of $$a$$
by $$a^2$$, or the second power, I say that the exponent becomes
greater by 2. Thus, the product of $$a^2$$ by $$a^2$$ is $$a^4$$; that of
$$a^2$$ by $$a^3$$ is $$a^5$$; that of $$a^4$$ by $$a^2$$ is $$a^6$$; and, more generally,
$$a^n$$ multiplied by $$a^2$$ makes $$a^{n+2}$$. With regard to negative
exponents, we shall have $$a^1$$, or $$a$$, for the product of $$a^{-1}$$ by
$$a^2$$; for $$a^{-1}$$ being equal to $$\frac{1}{a}$$, it is the same as if we had
divided $$aa$$ by $$a$$; consequently, the product required is
$$\frac{aa}{a}$$, or $$a$$; also $$a^{-2}$$, multiplied by $$a^2$$, produces $$a^0$$, or 1; and
$$a^{-3}$$, multiplied by $$a^2$$, produces $$a^{-1}$$.

<span class="art">183</span> It is no less evident, that to multiply any power of
$$a$$ by $$a^3$$, we must increase its exponent by three units; and
that, consequently, the product of $$a^n$$ by $$a^3$$ is $$a^{n+3}$$. And
whenever it is required to multiply together two powers of
$$a$$, the product will be also a power of $$a$$, and such that its
exponent will be the sum of those of the two given powers.
For example, $$a^4$$ multiplied by $$a^5$$ will make $$a^9$$, and $$a^{12}$$
multiplied by $$a^7$$ will produce $$a^{19}$$, etc.

<span class="art">184</span> From these considerations we may easily determine
the highest powers. To find, for instance, the twenty-fourth
power of 2, I multiply the twelfth power by the twelfth
power, because $$2^{24}$$ is the same amount as $$2^{12}$$ multiplied with $$2^{12}$$. Now, we have
already seen that $$2^{12}$$ is 4096; I say therefore that the number 16777216, or the product of 4096 by 4096, expresses
the power required, namely, $$2^{24}$$.

<span class="art">185</span> Let us now proceed to division. We shall remark,
in the first place, that to divide a power of $$a$$ by $$a$$, we must
subtract 1 from the exponent, or diminish it by unity; thus,
$$a^5$$ divided by $$a$$ gives $$a^4$$; and $$a^0$$, or 1, divided by $$a$$, is equal
to $$a^{-1}$$ or $$\frac{1}{a}$$; also $$a^{-3}$$ divided by $$a$$, gives $$a^{-4}$$.

<span class="art">186</span> If we have to divide a given power of $$a$$ by $$a^2$$ we
must diminish the exponent by 2; and if by $$a^3$$ we must
subtract 3 units from the exponent of the power proposed;
and, in general, whatever power of a it is required to divide
by any other power of $$a$$, the rule is always to subtract the
exponent of the second from the exponent of the first
of those powers: thus $$a^{15}$$ divided by $$a^7$$ will give $$a^8$$;
$$a^6$$ divided by $$a^7$$ will give $$a^{-1}$$; and $$a^{-3}$$ divided by $$a^4$$
will give $$a^{-7}$$.

<span class="art">187</span> From what has been said, it is easy to understand
the method of finding the powers of powers, this being
done by multiplication. When we seek, for example, the
square, or the second power of $$a^3$$, we find $$a^6$$; and in the
same manner we find $$a^{12}$$ for the third power, or the cube, of
$$a^4$$. To obtain the square of a power, we have only to double
its exponent; for its cube, we must triple the exponent; and
so on. Thus, the square of $$a^n$$ is $$a^{2n}$$; the cube of $$a^n$$ is $$a^{3n}$$;
the seventh power of $$a^n$$ is $$a^{7n}$$, etc.

<span class="art">188</span> The square of $$a^2$$, or the square of the square of $$a$$,
being $$a^4$$, we see why the fourth power is called the *biquadrate*:
also, the square of $$a^3$$ being $$a^6$$, the sixth power has
received the name of the square-cubed.

Lastly, the cube of $$a^3$$ being $$a^9$$, we call the ninth power
the cubo-cube: after this, no other denominations of this
kind have been introduced for powers; and, indeed, the two
last are very little used.
