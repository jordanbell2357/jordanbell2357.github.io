### Part {{ page.part}}. {{ page.title }}

<span class="art">31</span> We shall now proceed to indeterminate equations, in
which it is required to find two unknown quantities, one of
them being multiplied by the other, or raised to a power
higher than the first, whilst the other is found only in the
first degree. It is evident that equations of this kind may
be represented by the following general expression:

$$a+bx+cy+dx^2+exy+fx^3+gx^2y+hx^4+kx^3y+\textrm{etc.}=0.$$

As in this equation $$y$$ does not exceed the first degree, that
letter is easily determined; but here, as before, the values
both of $$x$$ and of $$y$$ must be assigned in integer numbers.

We shall consider some of those cases, beginning with the
easiest.

<span class="art">32</span> *Question 1.* To find two such numbers, that their
product added to their sum may be 79.

Call the numbers sought $$x$$ and $$y$$: then we must have
$$xy+x+y=79$$; so that $$xy+y=79-x$$, and

$$y=\dfrac{79-x}{x+1} = -1 + \dfrac{80}{x+1},$$

from which we see that $$x+1$$ must be a divisor of 80. Now, 80 having
several divisors, we shall also have several values of $$x$$, as the
following Table will show:

<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>8</th>
<th>10</th>
<th>16</th>
<th>20</th>
<th>40</th>
<th>80</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>therefore \(x\) =</th>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>39</td>
<td>79</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>and \(y\) =</td>
<td>79</td>
<td>39</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

But as the answers in the bottom line are the same as
those in the first, inverted, we have, in reality, only the five
following; namely,

<table>
<tr>
<td>\(x\) =</td>
<td>0,</td>
<td>1,</td>
<td>3,</td>
<td>4,</td>
<td>7, and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(y\) =</td>
<td>79,</td>
<td>39,</td>
<td>19,</td>
<td>15,</td>
<td>9.</td>
