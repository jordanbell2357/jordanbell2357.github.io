<span class="art">784</span> When the roots of an equation are not rational,
whether they may be expressed by radical quantities, or
even if we have not that resource, as is the case with equations which exceed the fourth degree,
we must be satisfied
with determining their values by approximation; that is to
say, by methods which are continually bringing us nearer to
the true value, till at last the error being very small, it may
be neglected. Different niethods of this kind have been proposed, the chief of which we shall explain.

<span class="art">785</span> The first method which we shall mention, supposes
that we have already determined, with tolerable exactness,
the value of one root; that we know, for example, that
such a value exceeds 4, and that it is less than 5. In this
case, if we suppose this value = $$4+p$$, we are certain that
$$p$$ expresses a fraction. Now, as $$p$$ is a fraction, and consequently less than unity,
the square of $$p$$, its cube, and, in
general, all the higher powers of $$p$$, will be much less with respect to unity;
and, for this reason, since we require only an
approximation, they may be neglected in the calculation.
When we have, therefore, nearly determined the fraction $$p$$,
we shall know more exactly the root $$4+p$$; from that we
proceed to determine a new value still more exact, and continue the same process till we come as near the truth as we
desire.

<span class="art">786</span> We shall illustrate this method first by an easy example, requiring by approximation the root of the equation
$$x^2=20$$.

Here we perceive, that $$x$$ is greater than 4 and less than 5;
making, therefore, $$x=4+p$$, we shall have

$$x^2=16+8p+p^2=20;$$

but as $$p^2$$ must be very small, we shall neglect it,
in order that we may only the equation $$16+8p=20$$, or $$8p=4$$.
This gives $$p=\frac{1}{2}$$, and $$x=4\frac{1}{2}$$,
which already approaches nearer the true root. If, therefore,
we now suppose $$x=4\frac{1}{2}+p'$$; we are sure that $$p'$$
expresses a fraction much smaller than before, and that we
may neglect $${p'}^2$$ with greater propriety. We have,
therefore, $$x^2=20\frac{1}{4}+9p'=20$$, or $$9p'=-\frac{1}{4}$$;
and consequently, $$p'=-\frac{1}{36}$$; therefore

$$x=4\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{36}=4\frac{17}{36}.$$

And if we wished to approximate still nearer to the true
value, we must make $$x=4\frac{17}{36}+p''$$, and should
thus have

$$x^2 = 20\frac{1}{1296} + 8\frac{34}{36}p''=20;$$

so that $$8\frac{34}{36}p''=-\frac{1}{1296}$$,

$$322p'=-\frac{36}{1296}=-\frac{1}{36},$$

and

$$p=-\dfrac{1}{36\cdot 322} = -\frac{1}{11592}:$$

therefore

$$x=4\frac{17}{36} - \frac{1}{11592} = 4\frac{4473}{11592},$$

a value which is so near the truth, that we may consider the error
as of no importance.
