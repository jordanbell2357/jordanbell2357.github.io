<span class="art">378</span> Two quantities are either equal to one another, or
they are not. In the latter case, where one is greater
than the other, we may consider their inequality under two
different points of view: we may ask, *how much* one
of the quantities is greater than the other? Or we may ask,
*how many times* the one is greater than the other? The
results which constitute the answers to these two questions
are both called *relations*, or *ratios*. We usually call the
former an arithmetical ratio, and the latter a geometrical
ratio, without however these denominations having any connection
with the subject itself. The adoption of these expressions has been entirely arbitrary.

<span class="art">379</span> It is evident, that the quantities of which we speak
must be of one and the same kind; otherwise we could not
determine any thing with regard to their equality, or inequality:
for it would be absurd to ask if two pounds and
three ells are equal quantities. So that in what follows,
quantities of the same kind only are to be considered;
and as they may always be expressed by numbers, it is of
numbers only that we shall treat, as was mentioned at the
beginning.

<span class="art">380</span> When of two given numbers, therefore, it is required how much the one is
greater than the other, the answer to this question determines the arithmetical ratio of
the two numbers; but since this answer consists in giving
the difference of the two numbers, it follows, that an arithmetical ratio is nothing but the difference between two
numbers; and as this appears to be a better expression, we
shall reserve the words ratio and relation to express geometrical ratios.

<span class="art">381</span> As the difference between two numbers is found by
subtracting the less from the greater, nothing can be easier
than resolving the question how much one is greater than
the other: so that when the numbers are equal, the difference being nothing,
if it be required how much one of the
numbers is greater than the other, we answer, by nothing;
for example, 6 being equal to 2 · 3, the difference between
6 and 2 · 3 is 0.

<span class="art">382</span> But when the two numbers are not equal, as 5 and
3, and it is required how much 5 is greater than 3, the
answer is, 2; which is obtained by subtracting 3 from 5.
Likewise 15 is greater than 5 by 10; and 20 exceeds 8
by 12.

<span class="art">383</span> We have therefore three things to consider on this
subject; 1st. the greater of the two numbers; 2nd. the less;
and 3rd. the difference: and these three quantities are so connected together,
that any two of the three being given, we
may always determine the third.

Let the greater number be $$a$$, the less $$b$$, and the difference
$$d$$; then $$d$$ will be found by subtracting $$b$$ from $$a$$, so that
$$d = a - b$$; whence we see how to find $$d$$, when $$a$$ and $$b$$ are
given.

<span class="art">384</span> But if the difference and the less of the two numbers,
that is, if $$d$$ and $$b$$ were given, we might determine the
greater number by adding together the difference and the
less number, which gives $$a=b+d$$; for if we take from
$$b + d$$ the less number $$b$$, there remains $$d$$, which is the
known difference: suppose, for example, the less number
is 12, and the difference 8, then the greater number will
be 20.

<span class="art">385</span> Lastly, if beside the difference $$d$$, the greater number $$a$$ be given,
the other number $$b$$ is found by subtracting
the difference from the greater number, which gives
$$b = a - d$$; for if the number $$a - d$$ be taken from the greater
number $$a$$, there remains $$d$$, which is the given difference.

<span class="art">386</span> The connection, therefore, among the numbers, $$a$$,
$$b$$, $$d$$, is of such a nature as to give the three following results:
1st. $$d = a - b$$; 2nd. $$a = b + d$$; 3rd. $$b = a - d$$;
and if one of these three comparisons be just, the others
must necessarily be so also: therefore, generally,
if $$z=x+y$$, it necessarily follows, that $$y = z - x$$, and $$x= z - y$$.

<span class="art">387</span> With regard to these arithmetical ratios we must
remark, that if we add to the two numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$, any
number $$c$$, assumed at pleasure, or subtract it from them, the
difference remains the same; that is, if $$d$$ is the difference
between $$a$$ and $$b$$, that number $$d$$ will also be the difference
between $$a + c$$ and $$b + c$$, and between $$a - c$$ and $$b - c$$.
Thus, for example, the difference between the numbers 20
and 12 being 8, that difference will remain the same, whatever number we add to,
or subtract from, the numbers 20 and 12.

<span class="art">388</span> The proof of this is evident: for if $$a-b=d$$, we
have also $$(a+c)-(b+c)=d$$; and likewise $$(a - c) - (b - c) = d$$.

<span class="art">389</span> And if we double the two numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$,
the difference will also become double; thus, when $$a - b = d$$, we
shall have $$2a - 2b = 2d$$; and, generally, $$na - nb = nd$$,
whatever value we give to $$n$$.
