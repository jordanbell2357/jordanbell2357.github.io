<span class="art">263</span> If we wish merely to represent subtraction, we enclose each expression within
two parentheses, joining, by the sign -, the expression which is to be subtracted,
to that from which we have to subtract it. When we subtract, for example, the
expression $$d-e+f$$ from the expression $$a-b+c$$, we write the remainder thus:

$$(a-b+c)-(d-e+f);$$

and this method of representing it sufficiently shews which of the two expressions is to
be subtracted from the other.

<span class="art">264</span> But if we wish to perform the actual subtraction, we must observe, first,
that when we subtract a positive quantity $$+b$$ from another quantity $$a$$, we
obtain $$a - b$$: and secondly, when we subtract a negative quantity $$-b$$ from $$a$$,
we obtain $$a + b$$; because to free a person from a debt is the same as to give him
something.

<span class="art">265</span> Suppose now it were required to subtract the expression $$b - d$$ from
$$a - c$$. We first take away $$b$$, which gives $$a - c - b$$: but this is taking away
too much by the quantity $$d$$, since we had to subtract only $$b - d$$; we must
therefore restore the value of $$d$$, and then shall have

$$a - c - b + d;$$

whence it is evident that the terms of the expression to be subtracted must change
their signs, and then be joined, with those contrary signs, to the terms of the
other expression.

<span class="art">266</span> Subtraction is therefore easily performed by this rule, since we have only to
write the expression from which we are to subtract, joining the other to it without
any change beside that of the signs. Thus, in the first example, where it was required
to subtract the expression $$d - e + f$$ from $$a - b + c$$, we obtain

$$a - b + c - d + e - f.$$

An example in numbers will render this still more clear;
for if we subtract 6 - 2 + 4 from 9 - 3 + 2, we evidently
obtain

9 - 3 + 2 - 6 + 2 - 4 = 0;

for 9 - 3 + 2 = 8; also, 6 - 2 + 4 = 8; and 8 - 8 = 0.

<span class="art">267</span> Subtraction being therefore subject to no difficulty,
we have only to remark, that if there are found in the remainder two or more terms,
which are entirely similar with
regard to the letters, that remainder may be reduced to
an abridged form, by the same rules which we have given
in addition.

<span class="art">268</span> Suppose we have to subtract $$a - b$$ from $$a + b$$;
that is, to take the difference of two numbers from their
sum: we shall then have $$(a+b)-(a-b)$$; but
$$a-a=0$$, and $$b+b=2b$$; the remainder sought is therefore
$$2b$$; that is to say, the double of the less of the two
quantities.

<span class="art">269</span> The following examples will supply the place of
further illustrations:

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
a^2&+ab&+b^2\\
b^2&-ab&+a^2\\
\hline
&+2ab&
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
3a&-4b&+5c\\
2b&+4c&-6a\\
\hline
9a&-6b&+c
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
a^3&+3a^2b&+3ab^2&+b^3\\
a^3&-3a^2b&+3ab^2&-b^3\\
\hline
&6a^2b&&+2b^3
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\surd a&+2\surd b\\
\surd a&-3\surd b\\
\hline
&+5\surd b
\end{array}
