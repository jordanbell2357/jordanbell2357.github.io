#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 18. "Of Roots, with relation to Powers in general."

**189.** Since the square root of a given number is a number,
whose square is equal to that given number; and since
the cube root of a given number is a number, whose cube is
equal to that given number; it follows that any number
whatever being given, we may always suppose such roots of
it, that the fourth, or the fifth, or any other power of them,
respectively, may be equal to the given number.
To distinguish these different kinds of roots better, we shall call the
square root, the second root; and the cube root, the third
root; because according to this denomination we may call
the fourth root, that whose biquadrate is equal to a given
number; and the fifth root, that whose fifth power is equal
to a given number, etc.

**190.** As the square, or second root, is marked by the sign
√, and the cubic, or third root, by the sign ∛, so the fourth
root is represented by the sign ∜; the fifth root by the sign
^ ; and so on. It is evident that, according to this method
of expression, the sign of the square root ought to be*/:
but as of all roots this occurs most frequently, it has been
aj^reed, for the sake of brevity, to omit the number 2 as the
sign of this root. So that when the radical sign has no num
