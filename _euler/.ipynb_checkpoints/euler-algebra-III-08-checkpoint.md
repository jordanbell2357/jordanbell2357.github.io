461. Two geometrical relations are equal when their
ratios are equal; and this equality of two relations is called
a **geometrical proportion**. Thus, for example, we write
$$a:b=c:d$$, or $$a:b::c:d$$, to indicate that the relation
$$a:b$$ is equal to the relation $$c:d$$; but this is more simply
expressed by saying $$a$$ is to $$b$$ as $$c$$ to $$d$$. The following is
such a proportion, 8:4∷12:6; for the ratio of the relation 8:4 is ²⁄₁,
or 2, and this is also the ratio of the relation 12:6.

462. So that $$a:b::c:d$$ being a geometrical proportion,
the ratio must be the same on both sides, consequently
$$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$$,
and, reciprocally, if the fractions $$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$$, we have
$$a:b::c:d$$.

463. A geometrical proportion consists therefore of four
terms, such, that the first divided by the second gives the
same quotient as the third divided by the fourth; and hence
we deduce an important property, common to all geometrical
proportions, which is, that the product of the first and the
last term is always equal to the product of the second and
third; or, more simply, that the product of the *extremes* is
equal to the product of the *means*.

464. In order to demonstrate this property, let us take
the geometrical proportion $$a:b::c:d$$, so that $$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$$.
Now, if we multiply both these fractions by $$b$$, we obtain
$$a = \frac{bc}{d}$$, and multiplying both sides farther by $$d$$, we have
$$ad=bc$$; but $$ad$$ is the product of the extreme terms, and
$$bc$$ is that of the means, which two products are found to be
equal.

465. Reciprocally, if the four numbers $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, $$d$$, are such,
that the product of the two extremes, $$a$$ and $$d$$, is equal to
the product of the two means, $$b$$ and $$c$$, we are certain that
they form a geometrical proportion: for, since $$ad=bc$$, we
have only to divide both sides by $$bd$$, which gives us
$$\frac{ad}{bd}=\frac{bc}{bd}$$, or $$\frac{a}{d}=\frac{c}{d}$$,
consequently $$a:b::c:d$$.

466. The four terms of a geometrical proportion, as
$$a:b::c:d$$, may be transposed in different ways, without
destroying the proportion; for the rule being always, that
the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the
means, or $$ad=bc$$, we may say,

1. $$b:a::d:c$$;
2. $$a:c::b:d$$;
3. $$d:b::c:a$$;
4. $$d:c::b:a$$.

467. Beside these four geometrical proportions, we may
deduce some others from the same proportion, $$a:b::c:d$$;
for we may say, $$a+b:a::c+d:c$$, or the first term,
plus the second, is to the first, as the third, plus the fourth,
is to the third; that is, $$a+b:a::c+d:c$$.

We may farther say, the first, minus the second, is to the
first, as the third, minus the fourth, is to the third, or
$$a-b:a::c-d:c$$. For, if we take the product of the extremes and the means,
we have $$ac - bc = ac - ad$$, which
evidently leads to the equality $$ad=bc$$.

And, in the same manner, we may demonstrate that
$$a+b:b::c+d:d$$; and that $$a-b:b::c-d:d$$.

468. All the proportions which we have deduced from
$$a:b::c:d$$ may be represented generally as follows:

$$ma+nb:pa+qb::mc+nd:pc+qd.$$

For the product of the extreme terms is
$$mpac+npbc+mqad+nqbd$$;
which, since $$ad=bc$$, becomes
$$mpac+npbc+mqbc+nqbd$$;
also the product of the mean terms is
$$mpac+mqbc+npad+nqbd$$;
or, since $$ad=bc$$, it is
$$mpac+mqbc+npbc+nqbd$$;
so that the two products are
equal.

469. It is evident, therefore, that a geometrical proportion being given,
for example, 6:3∷10:5, an infinite
number of others may be deduced from it. We shall, however, give only a few:

- 3:6∷5:10;
- 6:10∷3:5;
- 9:6∷15:10;
- 3:3∷5:5;
- 9:15∷3:5;
- 9:3∷15:5.

470. Since in every geometrical proportion the product of
the extremes is equal to the product of the means, we may,
when the three first terms are known, find the fourth from
them. Thus, let the three first terms be 24:15∷40 to
the fourth term : here, as the product of the means is 600,
the fourth term multiplied by the first, that is by 24, must
also make 600; consequently, by dividing 600 by 24 the
quotient 25 will be the fourth term required, and the whole
proportion will be 24:15∷40:25. In general, therefore,
if the three first terms are $$a:b::c$$; we put $$d$$ for
the unknown fourth letter; and since $$ad = bc$$, we divide
both sides by $$a$$, and have $$d=\frac{bc}{a}$$;
so that the fourth term
is $$\frac{bc}{a}$$, which is found by multiplying the second term by the
third, and dividing that product by the first.

471. This is the foundation of the celebrated *Rule of
Three* in Arithmetic; for in that rule we suppose three
numbers given, and seek a fourth, in geometrical proportion with those three;
so that the first may be to the
second, as the third is to the fourth.

472. But here it will be necessary to pay attention to some
particular circumstances. First, if in two proportions the
first and the third terms are the same, as in $$a:b::c:d$$,
and $$a:f::c:g$$, then the two second and the two fourth
terms will also be in geometrical proportion, so that
$$b:d::f:g$$,
for the first proportion being transformed into this,
$$a:c::b:d$$, and the second into this, $$a:c::f:g$$, it follows that the relations
$$b:d$$ and $$f:g$$ are equal, since each
of them is equal to the relation $$a:c$$. Thus, for example,
if 5:100∷2:40, and 5:15∷2:6, we must have
100:40∷15:6.

473. But if the two proportions are such, that the mean
terms are the same in both, I say that the first terms will be
in an inverse proportion to the fourth terms: that is, if
$$a:b::c:d$$, and $$f:b::c:g$$, it follows that $$a:f::g:d$$.
Let the proportions be, for example, 24:8∷9:3, and
6:8∷9:12, we have 24:6∷12:3; the reason is evident; for the first
proportion gives $$ad = bc$$; and the second
gives $$fg=bc$$; therefore $$ad=fg$$, and $$a:f::g:d$$, or
$$a:g::f:d$$.

474. Two proportions being given, we may always produce a new one by
separately multiplying the first term of
the one by the first term of the other, the second by the
second, and so on with respect to the other terms. Thus,
the proportions $$a:b::c:d$$, and $$e:f::g:h$$ will furnish
this, $$ac:bf::eg:dh$$; for the first giving $$ad = bc$$, and the
second giving $$eh=fg$$, we have also $$adeh = bcfg$$; but now
$$adeh$$ is the product of the extremes, and $$bcfg$$ is the product
of the means in ihe new proportion: so that the two products
being equal, the proportion is true.

475. Let the two proportions be 6:4∷15:10 and
9:12∷15:20, their combination will give the proportion

6 X 9 : 4 X 12 :: 15 X 15 : 10 X 20,
or 54 : 48 : : 225 : 200,
or 9 : 8 : : 9 : 8.

476. We shall observe, lastly, that if two products are
ci\uvi\, ad = h(., Mc may reciprocally convert this equality
into a geometrical proportion ; for we shall always have one
of the factors of the first product in the same pi'oportion to
one of the factors of the second product, as the other factor
of the second j^roduct is to the other factor of the first product : that is, in the present case, a : c : : b : d, or a : b : :
c : d. Let 3 x 8 = 4 x 6, and we may form from it this
proportion, 8 : 4 : : 6 : 3, or this, 3 : 4 : : 6 : 8. Likewise,
if 3 X 5 = 1 X 15, we shall have 3 : 15 : : 1 : 5, or 5 . 1 : :
15 : 3, or 3 : 1 : : 15 : 5.
