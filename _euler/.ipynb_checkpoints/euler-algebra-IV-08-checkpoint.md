### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section IV. "Of Algebraic Equations, and the Resolution of Them." Chapter 8. "Of the Extraction of the Square Roots of Binomials."

**669.** By a *binomials* we mean a quantity composed of
two parts, which are either both affected by the sign of the
square root, or of which one, at least, contains that sign.

For this reason 3+√5 is a binomial, and likewise
√8+√3; and it is indifferent whether the two terms be
joined by the sign + or by the sign - . So that 3 - √5
and 3 + √5 are both binomials.

**670.** The reason that these binomials deserve particular
attention is, that in the resolution of quadratic equations we
are always brought to quantities of this form, when the resolution cannot be performed. For example, the equation

$$x^2=6x-4$$

gives $$x = 3 + \surd 5$$.

It is evident, therefore, that such quantities must often
occur in algebraic calculations; for which reason, we have
already carefully shewn how they are to be treated in the
ordinary operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division, but we have not been able till now to show
how their square roots are to be extracted; that is, so far as
that extraction is possible; for when it is not, we must be
satisfied with affixing to the quantity another radical sign.
Thus, the square root of 3+√2 is written $$\sqrt{3 + \surd 2}$$;
$$\surd(3+\surd 2)$$.

**671.** It must here be observed, in the first place, that the
squares of such binomials are also binomials of the same
kind; in which also one of the terms is always rational.

For, if we take the square of $$a+\surd b$$. we shall obtain
$$(a^2+b)+2a\surd b$$. If therefore it were required reciprocally
to take the root of the quantity $$(a^2+b)+2a\surd b$$,
we should find it to be $$a+\surd b$$, and it is undoubtedly much easier to
form an idea of it in this manner, than if we had only put
the sign √ before the quantity.

**672.** It is chiefly required, therefore, to assign a character,
which may, in all cases, point out whether such a square
root exists or not; for which purpose we shall begin with an
easy quantity, requiring whether we can assign, in the sense
that we have explained, the square root of the binomial
5+2√6.

Suppose, therefore, that this root is $$\surd x+\surd y$$; the square of it
is $$(x+y)+2\surd xy$$, which must be equal to
the quantity 5+2√6. Consequently, the rational part $$x+y$$ must be equal to 5, and the irrational part
$$2\surd xy$$ must be equal to 2√6; which last equality gives $$\surd xy=\surd 6$$.
Now, since $$x+y=5$$,  we have $$y=5-x$$, and
this value substituted in the equation $$xy=6$$, produces
$$5x-x^2=6$$, or $$x^2=5x-6$$; therefore

$$x=\dfrac{5}{2}+\sqrt{\vphantom{\left( \dfrac{25}{4}-\dfrac{24}{4}\right)}}\left( \dfrac{25}{4}-\dfrac{24}{4}\right)=\dfrac{5}{2}+\dfrac{1}{2}=3.$$

So that $$x=3$$ and $$y=2$$; whence we
conclude, that the square root of 5+2√6 is √3+√2.

**673.** As we have here found the two equations, $$x + y = 5$$,
and $$xy = 6$$, we shall give a particular method for obtaining
the values of $$x$$ and $$y$$.

Since $$x+y = 5$$, by squaring, $$x^2+2xy+y^2= 25$$; and
as we know that $$x^2- 2xy + y^2$$ is the square of $$x - y$$, let
us subtract from $$x^2+2xy+y^2= 25$$, the equation $$xy=6$$,
taken four times, or $$4xy=24$$, in order to have
$$x^2-2xy+y^2=1$$; whence by extraction we have $$x-y=1$$; and as
$$x+y=5$$, we shall easily find $$x=2$$ and $$y=3$$:
wherefore, the square root of 5+2√6 is √3+√2.

**674.** Let us now consider the general binomial $$a+\surd b$$,
and supposing its square root to be $$\surd x+\surd y$$, we shall
have the equation

$$(x+y)+2\surd xy=a+\surd b;$$

so that $$x+y=a$$, and $$2\surd xy=\surd b$$, or $$4xy=b$$;
subtracting
this square from the square of the equation $$x+y=a$$, that
is, from $$x^2+2xy+y^2=a^2$$, there remains
$$x^2-2xy+y^2=a^2-b$$, the square root of which is
$$x-y=\surd(a^2-b)$$. Now, $$x+y=a$$; we have therefore
$$x=\dfrac{a+\surd(a^2-b)}{2}$$
and
$$y=\dfrac{a-\surd(a^2-b)}{2}$$;
consequently, the square root required of
$$a+\surd b$$ is

$$\dfrac{a+\surd(a^2-b)}{2}+\dfrac{a-\surd(a^2-b)}{2}.$$

**675.** We admit that this expression is more complicated
than if we had simply put the radical sign √ before the
given binomial $$a+\surd b$$, and written it
$$\surd(a+\surd b)$$:
but
the above expression may be greatly simplified when the
numbers
$$a$$ and $$b$$ are such, that $$a^2-b$$ is a square;
since
then the sign √, which is under the radical, disappears.
We see also, at the same time, that the square root of the
binomial $$a+\surd b$$ cannot be conveniently extracted, except
when $$a^2-b=c^2$$; for in this case the square root required is

$$
\sqrt{\vphantom{\left(\frac{a+c}{2}\right)}} \left(\frac{a+c}{2}\right) +
\sqrt{\vphantom{\surd\left(\frac{a-c}{2}\right)}}\left(\frac{a-c}{2}\right):
$$

but if $$a^2-b$$
is not a perfect square, we cannot express the square root of $$a+\surd b$$
more simply, than by putting the radical sign √ before it.

**676.** The condition, therefore, which is requisite, in order
that we may express the square root of a binomial $$a+\surd b$$
in a more convenient form, is, that $$a^2-b$$ be a square;
and
if we represent that square by $$c^2$$, we shall have for the
square root in question
