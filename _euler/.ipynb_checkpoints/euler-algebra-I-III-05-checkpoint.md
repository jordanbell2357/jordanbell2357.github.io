<span class="art">425</span> The summation of arithmetical progressions, which
begin by 1, and the difference of which is 1, 2, 3, or any
other integer, leads to the theory of *polygonal numbers*,
which are formed by adding together the terms of any such
progression.

<span class="art">426</span> Suppose the difference to be 1; then, since the first
term is 1 also, we shall have the arithmetical progression,

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.

and if in this progression we take the sum of one, of two, of three, etc. terms,
the following series of numbers will arise:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, etc.

for 1 = 1, 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, etc.

Which numbers are called **triangular**, or trigonal numbers, because we may always
arrange as many points in the form of a triangle as they contain units, thus:

$$
1\qquad
\begin{array}{c}
\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
3\qquad
\begin{array}{ccc}
\bullet&&\bullet\\
&\bullet&
\end{array}
$$

\begin{array}{ccccc}
\bullet&&\bullet&&\bullet\\

$$

<span class="art">427</span> In all these triangles, we see how many points
each side contains. In the first triangle there is only one
point; in the second there are two; in the third there are
three; in the fourth there are four, etc.: so that the triangular numbers,
or the number of points, which is simply
called the triangle, are arranged according to the number of
points which the side contains, which number is called the
**side**; that is, the third triangular number, or the third
triangle, is that whose side has three points; the fourth,
that whose side has four; and so on; which may be represented thus:

<span class="art">428</span> A question therefore presents itself here, whicli is,
how to determine the triangle when the side is given? and,
after what has been said, this may be easily resolved.

For if the side be $$n$$, the triangle will be 1 + 2 + 3 + â‹¯ + $$n$$.
Now, the sum of this progression is $$\dfrac{n^2+n}{2}$$;
consequently the value of the triangle is $$\dfrac{n^2+n}{2}$$.

Thus

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>\(n=1\)</td>
    <td>triangle is</td>
    <td>1,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(n=2\)</td>
    <td>triangle is</td>
    <td>3,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(n=3\)</td>
    <td>triangle is</td>
    <td>6,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(n=4\)</td>
    <td>triangle is</td>
    <td>10,</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

and so on: and when $$n = 100$$, the triangle will be 5050.

<span class="art">429</span> This formula $$\dfrac{n^2+n}{2}$$
is called the general formula of
triangular numbers; because by it we find the triangular
number, or the triangle, which answers to any side indicated
by $$n$$.


This may be transformed into $$\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$$;
which serves also
to facilitate the calculation; since one of the two numbers $$n$$,
or $$n+1$$, must always be an even number, and consequently
divisible by 2.


So, if $$n = 12$$, the triangle is $$\dfrac{12\cdot 13}{2}=6\cdot 13=78$$;
and if $$n=15$$, the triangle is $$\dfrac{15\cdot 16}{2}=15\cdot 8=120$$, etc.

<span class="art">430</span> Let us now suppose the difference to be 2, and we
sliall have the following arithmetical progression:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, etc.

the sums of which, taking successively one, two, three, four
terms, etc. form the following series:

1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, etc.

the terms of which are called quadrangular numbers, or
**squares**; since they represent the squares of the natural
numbers, as we have already seen; and this denomination
is the more suitable from this circumstance, that we can
always form a square with the number of points which those
terms indicate, thus:

$$
1\qquad
\begin{array}{c}
\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
4\qquad
\begin{array}{cc}
\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
9\qquad
\begin{array}{ccc}
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
16\qquad
\begin{array}{cccc}
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
25\qquad
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
36\qquad
\begin{array}{cccccc}
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet
\end{array}
$$

$$
49\qquad
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet\\
\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet&\bullet
\end{array}
$$


<span class="art">431</span> We see here, that the side of any square contains
precisely the number of points which the square root indicates. Thus, for example,
the side of the square 16 consists of 4 points; that of the square 25 consists of 5 points;
and, in general, if the side be $$n$$, that is, if the number of the
terms of the progression, 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. which we have
taken, be expressed by $$n$$, the square, or the quadrangular
number, will be equal to the sum of those terms; that is to
$$n^2$$, as we have already seen, <span class="artref">Art. 422</span>; but it is unnecessary
to extend our consideration of square numbers any
farther, having already treated of them at length.

<span class="art">432</span> If now we call the difference 3, and take the sums
in the same manner as before, we obtain numbers which are
called pentagons, or **pentagonal numbers**, though they cannot be so well represented by points

the indices showing the side of each pentagon.

<span class="art">433</span> It follows from this, that if we make the side $$n$$, the
pentagonal number will be $$\dfrac{3n^2-n}{2}=\dfrac{n(3n-1)}{2}$$.

Let, for example, $$n = 7$$, the pentagon will be 70; and if
the pentagon, whose side is 100, be required, we make
$$n = 100$$, and obtain 14950 for the number sought.

<span class="art">434</span> If we suppose the difference to be 4, we arrive at
**hexagonal numbers**, as we see by the following progressions:

where the indices still show the side of each hexagon.

<span class="art">435</span> So that when the side is $$n$$, the hexagonal number is
$$2n^2 - n = n(2n-1)$$; and we have farther to remark, that
all the hexagonal numbers are also triangular; since, if we
take of these last the first, the third, the fifth, etc. we have
precisely the series of hexagons.

<span class="art">436</span> In the same manner, we may find the numbers
which are heptagonal, octagonal, etc. It will be sufficient
therefore to exhibit the following Table of formulae for all
numbers that are comprehended under the general name of
polygonal numbers.


Supposing the side to be represented by $$n$$, we have

    <td>\(\dfrac{18n^2-16n}{2}=9n^2-8n=n(9n-8)\)</td>

    <td>\(m\)-gon</td>
    <td>\(\dfrac{(m-2)n^2-(m-4)n}{2}\)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span class="art">437</span> So that the side being $$n$$, the $$m$$-gonal number will
be represented by $$\dfrac{(m-2)n^2-(m-4)n}{2}$$;
whence we may deduce all the possible polygonal numbers which have the side
$$n$$. Thus, for example, if the bigonal numbers were required, we should have $$m = 2$$,
and consequently the number
sought $$= n$$; that is to say, the bigonal numbers are the
natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc.

If we make $$m = 3$$, we have $$\dfrac{n^2+n}{2}$$ for the triangular number required.

If we make $$m = 4$$, we have the square number $$n^2$$, etc.

<span class="art">438</span> To illustrate this rule by examples, suppose that
the 25-gonal number, whose side is 36, were required; we
look first in the Table for the 25-gonal number, whose
side is $$n$$, and it is round to be $$\dfrac{23n^2-21n}{2}$$.
Then making $$n = 36$$, we find 14526 for the number sought.

<span class="art">439</span> *Question.* A person bought a house, and he is
asked how much he paid for it. He answers, that the 365-gonal number of
side 12 is the number of crowns which it cost him.

In order to find this number, we make $$m=365$$, and
$$n = 12$$; and substituting these values in the general formula,
we find for the price of the house 23970 crowns.
