<span class="art">38</span> It is required in the present case to determine tlie
values which are to be adopted for x, in order that the
formula a -\- bx -\- ex" may become a real square; and,
consequently, that a rational root of it may be assigned.
Now, the letters r/, b, and c, represent given numbers ; and
The determination of the unknown quantity depends chiefly
on the nature of these numbers; there being many cases in
which the solution becomes impossible. But even when it is
possible, we must content ourselves at first with being able to
assign rational values for the letter $$x$$, without requiring those
values also to be integer numbers; as this latter condition
produces researches altogether peculiar.

<span class="art">39</span> We suppose here that the formula extends no farther
than the second power of $$x$$; the higher dimensions require
different methods, which will be explained in their proper
places.

We shall observe first, that if the second power were not
in the formula, and $$c$$ were = 0, the problem would be attended with no difficulty;
for if $$\surd(a+bx)$$ were the given formula, and it were required to determine $$x$$,
so that $$a+bx$$ might be a square, we should only have to make $$a+bx=y^2$$,
whence we should immediately obtain $$x=\dfrac{y^2-a}{b}$$. Now,
whatever number we substitute here for $$y$$, the value of $$x$$ would always
be such, that $$a+bx$$ would be a square, and consequently,
$$\surd(a+bx)$$ would be a rational quantity.
