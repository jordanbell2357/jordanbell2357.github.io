<span class="art">352</span> If we trace back the origin of the coefficients which
we have been considering, we shall find, that each term is
presented, as many times as it is possible to transpose the
letters, of which that term is composed; or, to express the
same thing differently, the coefficient of each term is equal to
the number of transpositions which the letters composing
that term admit of. In the second power, for example, the
term $$ab$$ is taken twice, that is to say, its coefficient is 2;
and in fact we may change the order of the letters which
compose that term twice, since we may write $$ab$$ and $$ba$$.
The term $$aa$$, on the contrary, is found only once, and here
the order of the letters can undergo no change, or transposition.
In the third power of $$a+b$$, the term $$aab$$ may
be written in three different ways; thus, $$aab$$, $$aba$$, $$baa$$; the
coefficient therefore is 3. In the fourth power, the term $$a^3b$$
or $$aaab$$ admits of four different arrangements, $$aaab$$, $$aaba$$,
$$abaa$$, $$baaa$$; and consequently the coefficient is 4. The term
$$aabb$$ admits of six transpositions, $$aabb$$, $$abba$$, $$baba$$, $$abab$$,
$$bbaa$$, $$baab$$, and its coefficient is 6. It is the same in all
other cases.

<span class="art">353</span> In fact, if we consider that the fourth power, for
example, of any root consisting of more than two terms, as
$$(a+b+c+d)^4$$, is found by the multiplication of the four
factors,

$$(a+b+c+d)(a+b+c+d)(a+b+c+d)(a+b+c+d),$$

we readily see, that each letter of the first
factor must be multiplied by each letter of the second, then
by each letter of the third, and, lastly, by each letter of the
fourth. So that every term is not only composed of four
letters, but it also presents itself, or enters into the sum, as
many times as those letters can be differently arranged with
respect to each other; and hence arises its coefficient.

<span class="art">354</span> It is therefore of great importance to know, in how
many different ways a given number of letters may be arranged;
but, in this inquiry, we must particularly consider,
whether the letters in question are the same, or different:
for when they are the same, there can be no transposition of
them; and for this reason the simple powers, as
$$a^2$$, $$a^3$$, $$a^4$$, etc. have all unity for their coefficients.

<span class="art">355</span> Let us first suppose all the letters different; and,
beginning with the simplest case of two letters, or $$ab$$,
we immediately discover that two transpositions may take place,
namely, $$ab$$ and $$ba$$.

If we have three letters, $$abc$$, to consider, we observe that
each of the three may take the first place, while the two
others will admit of two transpositions; thus, if $$a$$ be the first
letter, we have two arrangements $$abc$$, $$acb$$; if $$b$$ be in the first
place, we have the arrangements $$bac$$, $$bca$$; lastly, if $$c$$ occupy the first place,
we have also two arrangements, namely,
$$cab$$, $$cba$$; consequently the whole number of arrangements
is 3 · 2 = 6.

If there be four letters $$abcd$$, each may occupy the first
place; and in every case the three others may form six
different arrangements, as we have just seen; therefore the
whole number of transpositions is 4 · 6 = 24 = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1.

If we have five letters, $$abcde$$, each of the five may be the
first, and the four others will admit of twenty-four transpositions;
so that the whole number of transpositions will
be 5 · 24 = 120 = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1.

<span class="art">356</span> Consequently, however great the number of letters
may be, it is evident, provided they are all different, that we
may easily determine the number of transpositions, and that
we may for this purpose make use of the following Table:

<table>

  <tr>

<span class="art">357</span> But, as we have intimated, the numbers in this
Table can be made use of only when all the letters are different;
for if two or more of them are alike, the number of
transpositions becomes much less; and if all the letters are
the same, we have only one arrangement: we have therefore now shown
how the numbers in the Table are to be
diminished, according to the number of letters that are
alike.

<span class="art">358</span> When two letters are given, and those letters are
the same, the two arrangements are reduced to one, and
consequently the number, which we have found above, is
reduced to the half; that is to say, it must be divided by 2.
If we have three letters alike, the six transpositions are reduced to one;
whence it follows that the numbers in the
Table must be divided by 6 = 3 · 2 · 1; and, for the same
reason, if four letters are alike, we must divide the numbers
found by 24, or 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, etc.

It is easy therefore to find how many transpositions the
letters aaabbc, for example, may undergo. They are in
number 6, and consequently, if they were all different, they
would admit of 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 transpositions; but since
a is found thrice in those letters, we must divide that number of transpositions
by 3 · 2 · 1; and since b occurs twice,
we must again divide it by 2 · 1: the number of transpositions required will therefore be

$$\dfrac{6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60.$$

<span class="art">359</span> We may now readily determine the coefficients of
all the terms of any power; as for example of the seventh
power $$(a + b)^7$$.

The first term is $$a^7$$, which occurs only once; and as all
the other terms have each seven letters, it follows that the
number of transpositions for each term would be

7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1,

if all the letters were different; but since in the
second term, $$a^6b$$, we find six letters alike, we must divide
the above product by 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, whence it follows
that the coefficient is

$$\dfrac{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}=\frac{7}{1}.$$

In the third term, $$a^5b^2$$,
we find the same letter $$a$$ five
times, and the same letter $$b$$ twice; we must therefore
divide that number first by 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, and then by
2 · 1, whence results the coefficient

$$\dfrac{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 \cdot 2\cdot 1}=\dfrac{7 \cdot 6}{1 \cdot 2}.$$

The fourth term $$a^4b^3$$ contains the letter $$a$$ four times, and
the letter $$b$$ thrice; consequently, the whole number of the
transpositions of the seven letters, must be divided, in the
first place, by 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, and, secondly, by 3 · 2 · 1, and
the coefficient becomes

$$=\dfrac{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{4 \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 \cdot 2\cdot 1}=\dfrac{7 \cdot 6\cdot 5}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}.$$

In the same manner, we find
$$\dfrac{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4}{1 \cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4}$$
for the coefficient
of the fifth term, and so of the rest; by which the rule before
given is demonstrated.

<span class="art">360</span> These considerations carry us farther, and show us
also how to find all the powers of roots composed of more
than two terms. We shall apply them to the third power
of $$a + b + c$$; the terms of which must be formed by all
the possible combinations of three letters, each term having
for its coefficient the number of its transpositions, as shown,
<span class="artref">Art. 352</span>.

Here, without performing the multiplication, the third
power of $$(a + b+ c)$$ will be,

$$a^3+3a^2b+3a^2c+3ab^2+6abc+3ac^2+b^3+3b^2c+3bc^2+c^3.$$

Suppose $$a=1$$, $$b=1$$, $$c=1$$, the cube of 1 + 1 + 1, or 3,
will be

1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 27;

which result is accurate, and confirms the rule. But if we
had supposed $$a=1$$, $$b=1$$, and $$c=-1$$,
we should have
found for the cube of 1 + 1 - 1, that is of 1,

1 + 3 - 3 + 3 - 6 + 3 + 1 - 3 + 3 - 1,

which is a still farther confirmation of the rule.
