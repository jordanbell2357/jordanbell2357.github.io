·

**525.** We have already seen, in logarithmic calculations,
that Decimal Fractions are employed instead of Vulgar
Fractions: the same are also advantageously employed in
other calculations. It will therefore be very necessary to
show how a vulgar fraction may be transformed into a decimal fraction; and, conversely, how we may express the
value of a decimal, by a vulgar fraction.

**526.** Let it be required, in general, to cliange the fraction
$$\frac{a}{b}$$, into a decimal. As this fraction expresses the quotient
of the division of the numerator $$a$$ by the denominator $$b$$, let
us write, instead of $$a$$, the quantity $$a.0000000$$, whose value
does not at all differ from that of $$a$$, since it contains neither
tenth parts, hundredth parts, nor any other parts whatever.
If we now divide the quantity by the number $$b$$, according
to the common rules of division, observing to put the point
in the proper place, which separates the decimal and the integers, we shall obtain the decimal sought. This is the
whole of the operation, which we shall illustrate by some
examples.

Let there be given first the fraction ½, and the division in
decimals will assume this form:

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/njyeuwza">
<img src="/assets/euler/njyeuwza.png" alt="Integer long division ½" width="228" height="119" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

Hence it appears, that ½ is equal to 0.5000000 or 0.5;
which is sufficiently evident, since this decimal fraction represents ⁵⁄₁₀,
which is equivalent to ½.


**527.** Let now ⅓ be the given fraction, and we shall have,

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/pvnjgnaf">
<img src="/assets/euler/pvnjgnaf.png" alt="Integer long division ⅓" width="246" height="579" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

This shows, that the decimal fraction, whose value is ⅓,
cannot, strictly, ever be discontinued, but that it goes on, to
infinity, repeating always the number 3; which agrees
with what has been already shown, *Article 523*; namely, that
the fractions

$$\frac{3}{10}+\frac{3}{100}+\frac{3}{1000}+\frac{3}{10000}+\textrm{etc., to infinity} = \frac{1}{3}.$$

The decimal fraction which expresses the value of ⅔, is
also continued to infinity; for we have,

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/jkxijqxi">
<img src="/assets/euler/jkxijqxi.png" alt="Integer long division ⅔" width="246" height="579" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

Which is also evident from what we have just said, because
⅔ is the double of ⅓.

**528.** If ¼ be the fraction proposed, we have

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/xsxbzhmm">
<img src="/assets/euler/xsxbzhmm.png" alt="Integer long division ¼" width="232" height="184" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

So that ¼ is equal to 0.2500000, or to 0.25: which is
evidently true, since

²⁄₁₀+⁵⁄₁₀₀=²⁰⁄₁₀₀+⁵⁄₁₀₀=²⁵⁄₁₀₀=¼.

In like manner, we should have for the fraction ¾,

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/djkddmyz">
<img src="/assets/euler/djkddmyz.png" alt="Integer long division ¾" width="232" height="184" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

So that ¾=0.75: and in fact

⁷⁄₁₀+⁵⁄₁₀₀=⁷⁰⁄₁₀₀+⁵⁄₁₀₀=⁷⁵⁄₁₀₀=¾.

The fraction ⁵⁄₄ is changed into a decimal fraction, by
making

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/bksuqzrk">
<img src="/assets/euler/bksuqzrk.png" alt="Integer long division ⁵⁄₄" width="232" height="250" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

Now,

1+²⁵⁄₁₀₀=1+¼=⁵⁄₄.

**529.** In the same manner, ⅕ will be found equal to 0.2; ⅖ to 0.4; ⅗ to 0.6; ⅘ to 0.8; ⁵⁄₅ to 1; ⁶⁄₅ to 1.2, etc.

When the denominator is 6, we find ⅙=0.1666666,etc.
which is equal to 0.666666-0.5: but 0.666666=⅔, and
0.5=½, wherefore 0.1666666=⅔-½; or ⁴⁄₆-³⁄₆=⅙.

We find, also, ²⁄₆=0.333333,etc.=⅓; but ³⁄₆ becomes
0.5000000=½; also ⅚=0.833333=0.333333+0.5, that is to say,
⅓+½; or ²⁄₆+³⁄₆=⅚.

**530.** When the denominator is 7, the decimal fractions
become more complicated. For example, we find

⅐=0.142857;

however it must be observed that these six
figures are continually repeated. To be convinced, therefore, that this decimal fraction precisely expresses the value
of ⅐, we may transform it into a geometrical progression,
whose first term is ¹⁴²⁸⁵⁷⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀, the ratio being ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀;
and consequently, the sum equals

$$\dfrac{\dfrac{142857}{1000000}}{1-\dfrac{1}{1000000}}=\dfrac{142857}{1000000}=\dfrac{1}{7}.$$

**531.** We may prove, in a manner still more easy, that
the decimal fraction, which we have foiuid, is exactly equal to ⅐'
for, by substituting for its value the letter $$s$$, we have

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/tvrzyttr">
<img src="/assets/euler/tvrzyttr.png" alt="Decimals for ⅐" width="583" height="250" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

And, dividing by 999999, we have $$s$$=¹⁴²⁸⁵⁷⁄₉₉₉₉₉₉=⅐.
Wherefore the decimal fraction, which was represented by
$$s$$, is equal to ⅐.

**532.** In tlie same manner, ²⁄₇
may be transformed into a
decimal fraction, which will be 0.28571428,etc. and this
enables us to find more easily the value of the decimal
fraction which we have represented by $$s$$; because
0.28571428,etc. must be the double of it, and, consequently, equal
to $$2s$$. 
Now
we have seen that

$$100s=14.28571428571,\textrm{etc.}$$

So that subtracting

$$2s=0.28571428571,\textrm{etc.}$$

there remains

$$98s=14$$

wherefore $$s$$=¹⁴⁄₉₈=⅐.

We also find ³⁄₇=0.42857142857,etc. which, according
to our supposition, must be equal to $$3s$$;
and we have found that

$$10s=1.42857142857,\textrm{etc.}$$

So that subtracting

$$3s=0.42857142857,\textrm{etc.}$$

we have $$7s=1$$, wherefore $$s$$=⅐.

**533.** When a proposed fraction, therefore, has the denominator 7, the decimal fraction is infinite, and 6 figures
are continually repeated; the reason of which is easy to
perceive, namely, that when we continue the division, a remainder must return, sooner or later, which we have had
already. Now, in this division, 6 different numbers only
can form the remainder, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; so that,
at least, after the sixth division, the same figures must return;
but when the denominator is such as to lead to a division
without remainder, these cases do not happen.

**534.** Suppose now that 8 is the denominator of the
fraction proposed: we shall laid the following decimal
fractions:

⅛=0.125; ²⁄₈=0.25; ⅜=0.375; ⁴⁄₈=0.5; ⅝=0.625; ⁶⁄₈=0.75; ⅞=0.875, etc.

**535.** If the denominator be 9, we have





⅐ ²⁄₇  ³⁄₇  ⁴⁄₇ ⁵⁄₇ ⁶⁄₇ ⁷⁄₇

⅛       

⅑ ²⁄₉ ³⁄₉ ⁴⁄₉ ⁵⁄₉ ⁶⁄₉ ⁷⁄₉ ⁸⁄₉ ⁹⁄₉

¹⁄₁₁ ²⁄₁₁ ³⁄₁₁ ⁴⁄₁₁ ⁵⁄₁₁ ⁶⁄₁₁ ⁷⁄₁₁ ⁸⁄₁₁ ⁹⁄₁₁ ¹⁰⁄₁₁ ¹¹⁄₁₁
