<span class="art">24</span> In the preceding chapter, we have seen how, by means
of a single equation, two unknown quantities may be determined,
so far as to express them in integer and positive
numbers. If, therefore, we had two equations, in order that
the question may be indeterminate, those equations must
contain more than two unknown quantities. Questions of
this kind occur in the common books of arithmetic; and are
resolved by the rule called **Regula Coeci**, or **The Rule of False Position**;
the foundation of which we shall now explain, beginning with the following example:

<span class="art">25</span> *Question 1.* Thirty persons, men, wbmen, and children, spend 50 crowns in a tavern;
the share of a man is 3 crowns, that of a woman 2 crowns, and that of a child is 1
crown; how many persons were there of each class?

If the number of men be $$p$$, of women $$q$$, and of children $$r$$,
we shall have the two following equations;

1. $$p+q+r=30$$, and
2. $$3p+2q+r=50$$,

from which it is required to find the value of the three letters $$p$$, $$q$$,
$$r$$, in integer and positive numbers. The first equation gives
$$r=30-p-q$$; whence we immediately conclude that $$p+q$$ must be less than 30;
and, substituting this value of $$r$$ in the second equation, we have
$$2p+q+30=50$$; so that $$q=20-2p$$, and $$p+q=20-p$$, which evidently is
also less than 30. Now, as we may, in this equation, assume all numbers for $$p$$
which do not exceed 10, we shall have the following eleven answers:
the number of men $$p$$, of women $$q$$, and of children $$r$$, being as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<td>\(p\) = </td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(q\) =</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(r\) =</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
</table>

and, if we omit the first and the last, there will remain 9.
