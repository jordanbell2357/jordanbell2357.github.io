<span class="art">317</span> In order to give a certain rule for this operation, we
must consider attentively the square of the root $$a+b$$, which
is $$a^2+2ab+b^2$$, in order that we may reciprocally find the
root of a given square.

<span class="art">318</span> We must consider therefore, first, that as the square,
$$a^2+2ab+b^2$$, is composed of several terms, it is certain
that the root also will comprise more than one term; and
that if we write the terms of the square in such a manner,
that the powers of one of the letters, as $$a$$, may go on continually diminishing,
the first term will be the square of the
first term of the root; and since, in the present case, the
first term of the square is $$a^2$$, it is certain that the first term
of the root is $$a$$.

<span class="art">319</span> Having therefore found the first term of the root,
that is to say, $$a$$, we must consider the rest of the square,
namely, $$2ab+b^2$$, to see if we can derive from it the second
part of the root, which is $$b$$. Now, this remainder, $$2ab+b^2$$,
may be represented by the product, $$(2a+b)b$$; wherefore the remainder
having two factors, $$(2a+b)$$, and $$b$$, it is
evident that we shall find the latter, $$b$$, which is the second
part of the root, by dividing the remainder, $$2ab+b^2$$, by
$$2a+b$$.

<span class="art">320</span> So that the quotient, arising from the division of the
above remainder by $$2a+b$$, is the second term of the root
required; and in this division we observe, that $$2a$$ is the
double of the first term $$a$$, which is already determined: so
that although the second term is yet unknown, and it is
necessary, for the present, to leave its place empty, we may
nevertheless attempt the division, since in it we attend only
to the first term $$2a$$; but as soon as the quotient is found,
which in the present case is $$b$$, we must put it in the vacant
place, and thus render the division complete.

<span class="art">321</span> The calculation, therefore, by which we find the
root of the square $$a^2+2ab+b^2$$, may be represented thus

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
&&a^2&+2ab&+b^2&\vert&a+b\\
&&a^2&&&&\\
\hline
2a+b&\vert&&2ab&+b^2&\\
&&&2ab&+b^2&\\
\hline
&&&&0.&&
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">322</span> We may, also, in the same manner, find the square
root of other compound quantities, provided they are squares,
as will appear from the following examples:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
&&a^2&+6ab&+9b^2&\vert&a+3b\\
&&a^2&&&&\\
\hline
2a+3b&\vert&&6ab&+9b^2&\\
&&&6ab&+9b^2&\\
\hline
&&&&0.&&
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
&&4a^2&-4ab&+b^2&\vert&2a-b\\
&&4a^2&&&&\\
\hline
4a-b&\vert&&-4ab&+b^2&\\
&&&-4ab&+b^2&\\
\hline
&&&&0.&&
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
&&9p^2&+24pq&+16q^2&\vert&3p+4q\\
&&9p^2&&&&\\
\hline
6p+4q&\vert&&24pq&+16q^2&\\
&&&24pq&+16q^2&\\
\hline
&&&&0.&&
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
&&25x^2&-60x&+36&\vert&5x-6\\
&&25x^2&&&&\\
\hline
10x-6&\vert&&-60x&+36&\\
&&&-60x&+36&\\
\hline
&&&&0.&&
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">323</span> When there is a remainder after the division, it is a
proof that the root is composed of more than two terms.
We must in that case consider the two terms already found
as forming the first part, and endeavour to derive the other
from the remainder, in the same manner as we found the
second term of the root from the first. The following examples
will render this operation more clear.

<span class="art">324</span> We easily deduce from the rule which we have explained, the method which is taught in books of arithmetic
for the extraction of the square root, as will appear from the
following examples in numbers:[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]

<span class="art">325</span> But when there is a remainder after all the figures
have been used, it is a proof that the number proposed is
not a square; and, consequently, that its root cannot be
assigned. In such cases, the radical sign, which we before
employed, is made use of. This is written before the quantity,
and the quantity itself is placed between parentheses,
or under a line: thus, the square root of $$a^2+b^2$$ is represented by $$\surd(a^2+b^2)$$,
or by $$\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$; and $$\surd(1-x^2)$$, or
$$\sqrt{1-x^2}$$, expresses the square root of $$1-x^2$$. Instead of
this radical sign, we may use the fractional exponent $$\frac{1}{2}$$,
and represent the square root of $$a^2+b^2$$, for instance, by
$$(a^2+b^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$.
