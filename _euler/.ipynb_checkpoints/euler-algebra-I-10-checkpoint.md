> **101.** The rule for the multiplication of a fraction by an
> integer, or whole number, is to multiply the numerator
> only by the given number, and not to change the denominator: thus,
>
> 2 times ½ makes ²⁄₂, or one whole;
>
> 2 times ⅓ makes ⅔; and
>
> 3 times ⅙ makes ³⁄₆, or ½;
>
> 4 times ⁵⁄₁₂ makes ²⁰⁄₁₂, or 1⁸⁄₁₂, or 1⅔.
>
> But, instead of this rule, we may use that of dividing the
> denominator by the given integer, which is preferable, when
> it can be done, because it shortens the operation. Let it be
> required, for example, to multiply ⁸⁄₉ by 3; if we multiply
> the numerator by the given integer we obtain ²⁴⁄₉, which
> product we must reduce to ⁸⁄₃. But if we do not change
> the numerator, and divide the denominator by the integer,
> we find immediately ⁸⁄₃, or 2⅔, for the given product; and,
> in the same manner, ¹³⁄₂₄ multiphed by 6 gives ¹³⁄₄, or 3¼.
>
> **102.** In general, therefore, the product of the multiplication of a fraction
> $$\frac{a}{b}$$ by $$c$$ is $$\frac{ac}{b}$$;
> and here it may be remarked, when the integer is exactly equal to the denominator,
> that the product must be equal to the numerator.
>
> So that
>
> ½ taken 2 times, gives 1;
>
> ⅔ taken three times, gives 1;
>
> ¾ taken four times, gives 1.
>
> And, in general, if we multiply the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ by the
> number $$b$$, the product must be $$a$$, as we have already shown;
> for since $$\frac{a}{b}$$ expresses the quotient resulting from the division of the
> dividend $$a$$ by the divisor $$b$$, and because it has
> been demonstrated that the quotient multiplied by the divisor
> will give the dividend, it is evident that $$\frac{a}{b}$$ multiplied by $$b$$
> must produce $$a$$.
>
> **103.** Having thus shewn how a fraction is to be multiplied by an integer;
> let us now consider also how a fraction
> is to be divided by an integer. This inquiry is necessary,
> before we proceed to the multiplication of fractions by fractions. It is evident,
> if we have to divide the fraction ⅔ by
> 2, that the result must be ⅓; and that the quotient of ⁶⁄₇
> divided by 3 is ²⁄₇. The rule therefore is, to divide the
> numerator by the integer without changing the denominator.
> Thus
>
> ¹²⁄₂₅ divided by 2 gives ⁶⁄₂₅;
>
> ¹²⁄₂₅ divided by 3 gives ⁴⁄₂₅;
>
> ¹²⁄₂₅ divided by 4 gives ³⁄₂₅; etc.
>
> **104.** This rule may be easily practised, provided the
> numerator be divisible by the number proposed; but very
> often it is not: it must therefore be observed, that a fraction
> may be transformed into an infinite number of other expressions,
> and in that number there must be some, by which
> the numerator might be divided by the given integer. If
> it were required, for example, to divide ¾ by 2, we should
> change the fraction into ⁶⁄₈, and then dividing the numerator
> by 2, we should immediately have ⅜ for the quotient
> sought.
>
> In general, if it be proposed to divide the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$
> by $$c$$, we change it into $$\frac{ac}{bc}$$, and then dividing the numerator
> $$ac$$ by $$c$$, write $$\frac{a}{bc}$$ for the quotient sought.
>
> **105.** When therefore a fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is to be divided by an
> integer $$c$$, we have only to multiply the denominator by that
> number, and leave the numerator as it is. Thus ⅝ divided
> by 3 gives ⁵⁄₂₄, and ⁹⁄₁₆ divided by 5 gives ⁹⁄₈₀.
>
> This operation becomes easier, when the numerator itself
> is divisible by the integer, as we have supposed in **Article 103**.
> For example, ⁹⁄₁₆ divided by 3 would give, according
> to our last rule, ⁹⁄₄₈; but by the first rule, which is applicable here,
> we obtain ³⁄₁₆, an expression equivalent to ⁹⁄₄₈, but
> more simple.
>
> **106.** We shall now be able to understand how one fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$
> may be multiplied by another fraction $$\frac{c}{d}$$. For this purpose,
> we have only to consider that $$\frac{c}{d}$$ means that $$c$$ is divided by $$d$$;
> and on this principle we shall first multiply the
> fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ by $$c$$, which produces the result $$\frac{ac}{b}$$; after which
> we shall divide by $$d$$, which gives $$\frac{ac}{bd}$$.
>
> Hence the following rule for multiplying fractions. Multiply the numerators together for a numerator, > and the denominators together for a denominator. Thus,
>
> ½ by ⅔ gives the product ²⁄₆, or ⅓;
>
> ⅔ by ⅘ gives ⁸⁄₁₅;
>
> ¾ by ⁵⁄₁₂ produces ¹⁵⁄₄₈, or ⁵⁄₁₆; etc.
>
> **107.** It now remains to shew how one fraction may be
> divided by another. Here we remark first, that if the two
> fractions have the same number for a denominator, the
> division takes place only with respect to the numerators;
> for it is evident, that ³⁄₁₂ are contained as many times in ⁹⁄₁₂
> as 3 is contained in 9, that is to say, three times; and, in
> the same manner, in order to divide ⁸⁄₁₂ by ⁹⁄₁₂, we have only
> to divide 8 by 9, which gives ⁸⁄₉. We shall also have ⁶⁄₂₀
> in ¹⁸⁄₂₀, 3 times; ⁷⁄₁₀₀ in ⁴⁹⁄₁₀₀, 7 times; ⁷⁄₂₅ in ⁶⁄₂₅, ⁶⁄₇ times; etc.
>
> **108.** But when the fractions have not equal denominators,
> we must have recourse to the method already mentioned for
> reducing them to a common denominator. Let there be,
> for example, the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ to be divided by the fraction
> $$\frac{c}{d}$$. We first reduce them to the same denominator, and
> there results $$\frac{ad}{bd}$$ to be divided by $$\frac{cb}{bd}$$; it is now evident
> that the quotient must be represented simply by the division
> of $$ad$$ by $$bc$$; which gives $$\frac{ad}{bc}$$.
>
> Hence the following rule: Multiply the numerator of the
> dividend by the denominator of the divisor, and the denominator of
> the dividend by the numerator of the divisor;
> then the first product will be the numerator of the quotient,
> and the second will be its denominator.
