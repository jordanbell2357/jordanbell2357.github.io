#### Section III. "Of Ratios and Proportions." Chapter 11. "Of Geometrical Progressions."

**505.** A series of numbers, which are always becoming a
certain number of times greater, or less, is called a **geometrical progression**,
because each term is constantly to the
following one in the same geometrical ratio: and the number
which expresses how many times each term is greater than
the preceding, is called the *exponent*, or *ratio*. Thus, when
the first term is 1 and the exponent, or ratio, is 2, the geometrical progression becomes,

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Terms</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Progression</td>
    <td>1,</td>
    <td>2,</td>
    <td>4,</td>
    <td>8,</td>
    <td>16,</td>
    <td>32,</td>
    <td>64,</td>
    <td>128,</td>
    <td>256,</td>
    <td>etc.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. always marking the place which
each term holds in the progression.

**506.** If we suppose, in general, the first term to be $$a$$,
and the ratio $$b$$, we have the following geometrical progression

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Terms</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>⋯</td>
    <td>\(n\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Progression</td>
    <td>\(a\)</td>
    <td>\(ab\)</td>
    <td>\(ab2\)</td>
    <td>\(ab3\)</td>
    <td>\(ab4\)</td>
    <td>\(ab5\)</td>
    <td>\(ab6\)</td>
    <td>\(ab7\)</td>
    <td>⋯</td>
    <td>\(ab^{n-1}\)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

So that, when this progression consists of $$n$$ terms, the
last term is $$ab^{n-1}$$. We must, however, remark here, that if
the ratio $$b$$$ be greater than unity, the terms increase continually;
if $$b=1$$, the terms are all equal; lastly, if $$b$$ be
less than 1, or a fraction, the terms continually decrease.
Thus, when $$a=1$$, and $$b=\frac{1}{2}$$, we have this geometrical
progression:

1, ½, ¼, ⅛, ¹⁄₁₆, ¹⁄₃₂, ¹⁄₆₄, ¹⁄₁₂₈, etc.

**507.** Here therefore we have to consider:

1. The first term, which we have called $$a$$.
2. The exponent, which we call $$b$$.
3. The number of terms, which we have expressed by $$n$$.
4. And the last term, which, we have already seen, is expressed by $$ab^{n-1}$$.

So that, when the first three of these are given, the last term
is found by multiplying the $$n-1$$ power of $$b$$, or $$b^{n-1}$$,
by the first term $$a$$.

If, therefore, the 50th term of the geometrical progression
1, 2, 4, 8, etc. were required, we should have $$a=1$$, $$b = 2$$,
and $$n=50$$; consequently the 50th term would be $$2^{49}$$; and
as $$2^9$$=512, we shall have $$2^{10}$$=1024; wherefore the square
of $$2^{10}$$, or $$2^{20}$$, =1048576, and the square of this number,
which is 1099511627776=$$2^{40}$$. Multiplying therefore this
value of $$2^{40}$$ by $$2^9$$, or 512, we have $$2^{49}$$ = 562949953421312
for the 50th term.

**508.** One of the principal questions which occurs on this
subject, is to find the sum of all the terms of a geometrical
progression; we shall therefore explain the method of doing
this. Let there be given, first, the following progression,
consisting of ten terms:
