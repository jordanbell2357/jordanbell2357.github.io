<span class="art">750</span> When the highest power of the quantity $$x$$ rises to
the fourth degree, we have equations of the fourth degree,
the general form of which is

$$x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0.$$

We shall, in the first place, consider pure equations of
the fourth degree, the expression for which is simply $$x^4=f$$;
the root of which is immediately found by extracting the
biquadrate root of both sides, since we obtain $$x=\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{f}}f$$.

<span class="art">751</span> As $$x^4$$ is the square of $$x^2$$, the calculation is greatly facilitated by beginning
with the extraction of the square root; for we shall then have $$x^2 = \surd f$$; and, taking the
square root again, we have $$x=\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{f}}f$$; so that $$\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{f}}f$$
is nothing but the square root of the square root of $$f$$.

For example, if we had the equation $$x^4=2401$$, we should immediately have $$x^2=49$$, and then $$x=7$$.

<span class="art">752</span> It is true this is only one root; and since there are
always three roots in an equation of the third degree, so also
there are four roots in an equation of the fourth degree:
but the method which we have explained will actually give
those four roots. For, in the above example, we have not
only $$x^2=49$$, but also $$x^2=-49$$; now, the first value gives
the two roots $$x=7$$ and $$x=-7$$, and the second value gives
$$x = \surd -49 = 7\surd -1$$,
and $$x=-\surd -49=-7\surd -1$$; whcih are the four biquadrate roots of 2401.
The same is also true with respect to other numbers.
