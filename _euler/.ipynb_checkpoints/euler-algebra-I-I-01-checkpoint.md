<span class="art">1</span> Whatever is capable of increase or diminution,
is called magnitude, or quantity.

A sum of money therefore
is a quantity, since we may increase it or diminish it.
It is the same with a weight, and other things of this nature.

<span class="art">2</span> From this definition, it is evident, that the
different kinds of magnitude must be so various, as to render it
difficult to enumerate them: and
this is the origin of the different branches
of the Mathematics, each being employed on a particular kind of magnitude.
Mathematics, in general, is the science of quantity;
or, the science which investigates the means of measuring quantity.

<span class="art">3</span> Now, we cannot measure or determine any quantity,
except by considering some other quantity of the same kind
as known, and pointing
out their mutual
relation.
If it were proposed, for example, to determine the quantity of a
sum of money, we should take some known piece of money,
as a louis, a crown, a ducat, or some other coin, and shew
how many of these pieces are contained in
the given sum.
In the same manner,
if it were proposed to determine the
quantity of a weight, we should take a certain known weight;
for example, a pound, an ounce,
etc. and then show how
many times one of these weights is contained in that which
we are endeavouring to ascertain.
If we wished to measure
any length or extension, we should make use of some known
length, such as a foot.

<span class="art">4</span> So that the determination,
or the measure of magnitude of all kinds, is reduced to this:
fix at pleasure upon any one known magnitude of the same
species with that which is to be determined, and consider
it as the measure or unit;
then, determine the proportion of the proposed magnitude to this known measure.
This proportion
is always expressed by numbers; so that a number is nothing but the
proportion of one magnitude to another arbitrarily assumed
as the unit.

From this it appears, that
all magnitudes may be expressed by numbers; and
that the foundation of all the
Mathematical Sciences must be laid
in a complete treatise on the science of Numbers, and in an accurate examination
of the different possible methods of calculation.
This fundamental part of mathematics is called Analysis,
or Algebra.

<span class="art">6</span> In Algebra
then we consider
only numbers, which represent quantities, without regarding the
different kinds of quantity.
These are the subjects of other branches of
the mathematics.

<span class="art">7</span> Arithmetic
treats of numbers in particular, and is the
science of numbers properly so called; but
this science extends only to certain methods of calculation which occur in
common practice: Algebra, on
the contrary, comprehends in general
all the
cases that can exist in
the doctrine and
calculation of numbers.
