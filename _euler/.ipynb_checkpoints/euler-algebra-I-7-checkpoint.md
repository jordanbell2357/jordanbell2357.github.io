### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

With corrections by me to Hewlett's English translation, using the German text from the
*Leonhardi Euleri Opera omnia*. In particular, "one integer" in the English text
corresponds to "ein Gantzes" in the German text, which is properly translated
"one whole". (The English translation is through the French translation, and the
French "entier" can mean both "integer" and "whole".)

> 7S. We have seen that a fraction whose numerator is
equal to the denominator, is equal to unity. All fractions
therefore whose numerators are less than the denominators,
liave a value less than unity ; for if I have a number to
divide by another, which is greater than itself, the result
must necessarily be less than 1. If we cut a line, for example, two feet long, into three parts, one of those parts will
undoubtedly be shorter than a foot: it is evident then, that
-i is less than 1, for the same reason ; that is, the numerator
2 is less than the denominator 3.
>
> 74'. If the numerator, on the contrary, be greater than the
denominator, the value of the fraction is greater than unity.
Thus -I is greater than I, for | is equal to I- together with f.
Now -Iis exactly 1 ; consequently f is equal to 1 -|- f, that
is, to an integer and a half In the same manner, i is equal
to 1~, I- to 1~, and |- to 2}. And, in general, it is sufficient
in such cases to divide the u]")per number by the lower, and
to add to the quotient a fraction, having the remainder for
the numerator, and the divisor for the denominator. If the
given fraction, for example, were |4j "^^ should have for the
quotient 3, and 7 for the remainder; whence we should
conclude that -f | is the same as 3/^^.

75. Thus we see how fractions, whose numerators are
greater than the denominators, are resolved into two members ; one of which is an integer, and the other a fractional
number, having the numerator less than the denominator.
Such fractions as contain one or more integers, are called
improperJ'ractions, to distinguish them from fractions proj)erly so called, which having the numerator less than the
denominator, are less than unity, or than an integer.


76. The nature of fractions is frequently considered in
another way, which may throw additional light on the subject. If, for example, we consider the fraction i, it is evident
that it is three times greater than J. Now, this fraction ~
means, that if we divide 1 into 4 equal parts, this will be the
value of one of those parts; it is obvious then, that by
taking 3 of those parts we shall have the value of the
fraction 1.

In the same manner we may consider every other fraction ;
for example, -/^ ; if we divide unity into 12 equal parts, 7 of
ihose pxu'ts will be equal to the fraction proposed.

77. From this manner of considering fractions, the expressions numerator and denominator are derived. For, as
in the preceding fraction -^j the number under the line
shews that 12 is the number of parts into which unity is to
be divided ; and as it may be said to denote, or name, the
parts, it has not improperly been called the denominator.

Farther, as the upper number, viz. 7, shews that, in order
to have the value of the fraction, we must take, or collect, 7
of those parts, and therefore may be said to reckon or number them, it has been thought proper to call the number
above the line the numerator.

78. As it is easy to understand what A is, when we know
the signification of J, we may consider the fractions whose
numerator is unity, as the foundation of all others. Such
are the fractions, IIIIIIII 1 1 I iirf.
"a? T' T' T> ^J y S"' T' To» TT5 TzJ "'^'
and it is observable that these fractions go on continually
diminishing: for the more you divide an integer, or the
greater the number ofparts into which you distribute it, the less
does each of those parts become. Thus, —^ is less than —^ ;
-P^Vo is less than -pi^; and t^^^o is less than -r^, &c.

79. As we have seen that the more we increase the denominator of such fractions the less their values become, it
may be asked, whether it is not possible to make the denominator so great that the fraction shall be reduced to
nothing.? I answer, no; for into whatever number of parts
unity (the length of a foot, for instance) is divided; let
those parts be ever so small, they will still preserve a certain
magnitude, and therefore can never be absolutely reduced
to nothing.

80. It is true, if we divide the length of a foot into 1000
parts, those parts will not easily fall under the cognisance of
our senses ; but view them through a good microscope, and
each of them will appear large enough to be still subdivided
into 100 parts, and more.

At present, however, we have nothing to do with what
depends on ourselves, or with what we are really capable of
performing, and what our eyes can perceive ; the question
is rather what is possible in itself: and, in this sense, it is
certain, that however great we suppose the denominator, the
fraction will never entirely vanish, or become equal to 0.

81. We can never therefore arrive completely at 0, or
nothing, however great the denominator may be ; and, consequently, as those fractions must always preserve a certain quantity, wc may continue the scries of fractions in the
7Sth article without interruption. This circumstance has in-
troduced tlic expression, that the denominator must be inJinite, or infinitely great, in oi-der that the Traction may be
reduced to 0, or to notliing-; hence the word mfinite m
reahty signifies here, that we can never arrive at the end of
the series of the above-mentioned //•«c/io?z.y.

S2. To express this idea, according to the sense of it
above-mentioned, ,we make use of the sign oo , which consecjuently indicates a number infinitely great; and we may
therelbre say, that this fraction ^ is in reality nothing ; because a fraction cannot be i*educed to nothing, until the
denominator has been increased to injtnity.

83. It is the more necessary to pay attention to this idea of
infinity, as it is derived from the first elements of our knowledge, and as it will be of the greatest importance in the
following part of this treatise.

We may hei-e deduce from it a few consequences that are
extremely curious, and worthy of attention. The fraction ^
represents the quotient resulting from the division of the
dividend 1 by the divisor cc. Now, we know, that if we
divide the dividend 1 by the quotient ^, which is equal to
nothing, we obtain again the divisor co : hence we acquire
a new idea of infinity ; and learn that it arises from the
division of 1 by 0; so that we are thence authorised in
saying, that 1 divided by expresses a number infinitely
great, or go.

84. It may be necessary also, in this place, to correct tlie
mistake of those who assert, that a number infinitely great
is not susceptible of increase. This opinion is inconsistent
with the just principles which we have laid down; for ^
signifying a number infinitely great, and ^ being incontestably the double of -' , it is evident that a number, though
infinitely great, may still become twice, thrice, or any number of times greater
