<span class="art">220</span> Resuming the equation $$a^b=c$$, we shall begin by
remarking that, in the doctrine of Logarithms, we assume
for the root $$a$$, a certain number taken at pleasure, and suppose this
root to preserve invariably its assumed value.
This being laid down, we take the exponent $$b$$ such, that
the power $$a^b$$ becomes equal to a given number $$c$$; in
which case this exponent $$b$$ is said to be the *logarithm* of the
number $$c$$. To express this, we shall use the letter L or
the initial letters $$\log$$. Thus, by $$b = \textrm{L} c$$, or $$b =\log c$$,
we mean that $$b$$ is equal to the logarithm of the number $$c$$,
or that the logarithm of $$c$$ is $$b$$.

<span class="art">221</span> We see then, that the value of the root $$a$$ being
once established, the logarithm of any number, $$c$$, is nothing more than the
exponent of that power of $$a$$, which is equal
to $$c$$: so that $$c$$ being $$=a^b$$, $$b$$ is the logarithm of the power $$a^b$$.
If, for the present, we suppose $$b= 1$$, we have 1 for
the logarithm of $$a^1$$, and consequently $$\log a = 1$$; but if we
suppose $$b = 2$$, we have 2 for the logarithm of $$a^2$$; that is to
say, $$\log a^2 =2$$, and we may, in the same manner, obtain
$$\log a^3=3$$; $$\log a^4=4$$; $$\log a^5=5$$, and so on.

<span class="art">222</span> If we make $$b=0$$, it is evident that 0 will be the logarithm of $$a^0$$;
but $$a^0=1$$; consequently $$\log 1=0$$, whatever be the value of the root $$a$$.

Suppose $$b=-1$$, then -1 will be the logarithm of $$a^{-1}$$; but $$a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$$;
so that we have $$\log \frac{1}{a}=-1$$, and in the same manner,
we shall have $$\log \frac{1}{a^2} = -2$$; $$\log \frac{1}{a^3} = -3$$;
$$\log \frac{1}{a^4}=-4$$, etc.

<span class="art">223</span> It is evident, then, how we may represent the logarithms of all the powers of $$a$$, and
even those of fractions, which have unity for the numerator, and for the
denominator a power of $$a$$. We see also, that in all those cases the logarithms are integers;
but it must be observed, that if $$b$$ were a fraction, it would be the logarithm of an
irrational number: if we suppose, for example, $$b=\frac{1}{2}$$, it follows,
that $$\frac{1}{2}$$ is the logarithm of $$a^{1/2}$$,
or of $$\surd a$$; consequently we have also $$\log \surd a= \frac{1}{2}$$; and we shall find,
in the same manner, that $$\log \sqrt[3]{\vphantom{a}} a = \frac{1}{3}$$, $$\log \sqrt[4]{\vphantom{a}} a = \frac{1}{4}$$, etc.

<span class="art">224</span> But if it be required to find the logarithm of another
number $$c$$, it will be readily perceived, that it can neither
be an integer, nor a fraction; yet there must be such an exponent $$b$$, that
the power $$a^b$$ may become equal to the number proposed; we have therefore $$b \log c$$;
and generally, $$a^{\textrm{L}c} = c$$.

<span class="art">225</span> Let us now consider another number d, whose logarithm has been represented in a similar
manner by $$\log d$$; so that $$a^{\textrm{L}d} = d$$. Here if we multiply this expression by the
preceding one $$a^{\textrm{L}c} = c$$, we shall have
$$a^{\textrm{L}c+\textrm{L}d} =cd$$; hence, the exponent is always the logarithm of the power;
consequently,

$$\log c + \log d = \log cd.$$

But if, instead of multiplying, we divide the former expression by the latter,
we shall obtain $$a^{\textrm{L}c-\textrm{L}d}=\frac{c}{d}$$;
and, consequently,

$$\log c - \log d = \log \frac{c}{d}.$$

<span class="art">226</span> This leads us to the two principal properties of logarithms, which are contained in the
equations

$$\log c + \log d = \log cd,$$

and

$$\log c - \log d = \log \frac{c}{d}.$$

The former of these equations teaches us, that the logarithm of a product, as $$cd$$, is found by
adding together the logarithms of the factors; and the latter shows us this property, namely,
that the logarithm of a fraction may be determined by subtracting the logarithm of the
denominator from that of the numerator.

<span class="art">227</span> It also follows from this, that when it is required to
multiply, or divide, two numbers by one another, we have
only to add, or subtract, their logarithms; and this is what
constitutes the singular utility of logarithms in calculation:
for it is evidently much easier to add, or subtract, than to
multiply, or divide, particularly when the question involves
large numbers.

<span class="art">228</span> Logarithms are attended with still greater advantages,
in the involution of powers, and in the extraction of roots;
for if $$d=c$$, we have, by the first property,
$$\log c + \log c = \log cc$$ or $$c^2$$; consequently, $$\log cc = 2 \log c$$;
and in the same manner, we obtain $$\log c^3 = 3 \log c$$;
$$\log c^4=4\log c$$; and, generally, $$\log c^n=n\log c$$.
If we now substitute fractional numbers for $$n$$, we shall have,
for exmaple, $$\log c^{\frac{1}{2}}$$, that is to say, $$\log \sqrt{\vphantom{c}} c$$, $$=\frac{1}{2}\log c$$;
and lastly, if we suppose $$n$$ to represent negative numbers, we shall
have $$\log c^{-1}$$, or $$\log \frac{1}{c}$$, $$=-\log c$$;
$$\log c^{-2}$$, or $$\log \frac{1}{c^2}$$, $$=-2\log c$$,
and so on; which follows not only from the equation
$$\log c^n = n \log n$$, but also from $$\log 1=0$$, as we have
already seen.

<span class="art">229</span> If therefore we had Tables, in which logarithms were calculated for all numbers, we might
certainly derive from them very great assistance in performing the most prolix calculations;
such, for instance, as require frequent multiplications, divisions, involutions, and extractions
of roots: for, in such Tables, we should have not only the logarithms of all numbers, but also
the numbers answering to all logarithms. If it were required, for example,
to find the square root of the number $$c$$, we must first find the logarithm of $$c$$,
that is, $$\log c$$,
and next taking the half of that logarithm, or $$\frac{1}{2}\log c$$, we should have the
logarithm of the square root required:
we have therefore only to look in the Tables for the number answering to that logarithm,
in order to obtain the root required.

<span class="art">230</span> We have already seen, that the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. that is to say,
all positive numbers, are logarithms of the root a, and of its positive powers; consequently,
logarithms of numbers greater than unity: and, on the contrary, that the negative numbers,
as -1, -2, etc. are logarithms of the fractions $$\frac{1}{a}$$, $$\frac{1}{a^2}$$, etc. which are
less than unity, but yet greater than nothing.

Hence, it follows, that, if the logarithm be positive, the number is always greater than unity:
but if the logarithm be negative, the number is always less than unity, and yet greater than 0;
consequently, we cannot express the logarithms of negative numbers: we must therefore conclude,
that the logarithms of negative numbers are impossible, and that they belong to the class of
imaginary quantities.

<span class="art">231</span> In order to illustrate this more fully, it will be proper to fix on a determinate number
for the root $$a$$. Let us make choice of that, on which the common Logarithmic Tables are formed,
that is, the number 10, which has been preferred, because it is the foundation of our Arithmetic.
But it is evident that any other number, provided it were greater than unity, would answer the
same purpose: and the reason why we cannot suppose $$a=$$ unity, or 1, is manifest;
because all the powers $$a^b$$ would then be constantly equal to unity, and could never
become equal to another given number, $$c$$.
