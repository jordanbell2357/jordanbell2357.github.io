#### Section IV. "Of Algebraic Equations, and the Resolution of Them." Chapter 12. "Of the Rule of Cardano, or of Scipione del Ferro."

**734.** When we have removed fractions from an equation
of the third degree, according to the manner which has been
explained, and none of the divisors of the last term are
found to be a root of the equation, it is a certain proof, not
only that the equation lias no root in integer numbers, but
also that a fractional root cannot exist; which may be
proved as follows.

Let there be given the equation

in which,


express integer numbers. If we suppose,
for example,

we shall have

Now, the first term only has 8 for the denominator; the
others being either integer numbers, or numbers divided
only by 4 or by 2, and therefore cannot make with the
first term. The same thing happens with every other
fraction.


**735.** As in those fractions the roots of the equation are
neither inteoer numbers, nor fractions, they are irrational,
and, as it often happens, imaginary. The manner, therefore, of expressing them,
and of determining the radical
signs which affect them, forms a very important point, and
deserves to be carefully explained. This method, called *Cardano's Rule*,
is ascribed to Cardano, ov more properly to Scipione del Ferro,
both of whom lived some centuries since.

**736.** In order to understand this rule, we must first attentively consider
the nature of a cube, whose root is a binomial.

Let

that root ; then the cube of it will be

and we see that it is composed of
the cubes of the two terms of the binomial, and beside that,
of the two middle terms,

which have the common factor 3ab, multiplying the other ftictor,

that is
to say, the two terms contain thrice the product of the two
terms of the binomial, multiplied by the sum of those terms.

7o7. Let us now suppose


taking the cube of
each side, we have

and, since

\ve shall have the equation, 

or

one of the roots of which we know
to be

Whenever, therefore, such an equation
occurs, we may assign one of its roots.

For example, let

and

we shall then have
the equation

which we know with certainty
to have x=5 for one of its roots.

738. Farther, let us now suppose
