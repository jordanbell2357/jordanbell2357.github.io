### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 21. "Of Logarithms in general."

**220.** Resuming the equation $$a^b=c$$, we shall begin by
remarking that, in the doctrine of Logarithms, we assume
for the root $$a$$, a certain number taken at pleasure, and suppose this
root to preserve invariably its assumed value.
This being laid down, we take the exponent $$b$$ such, that
the power $$a^b$$ becomes equal to a given number $$c$$; in
which case this exponent $$b$$ is said to be the *logarithm* of the
number $$c$$. To express this, we shall use the letter L or
the initial letters $$\log$$. Thus, by $$b = \textrm{L} c$$, or $$b =\log c$$,
we mean that $$b$$ is equal to the logarithm of the number $$c$$,
or that the logarithm of $$c$$ is $$b$$.

**221.** We see then, that the value of the root $$a$$ being
once established, the logarithm of any number, $$c$$, is nothing more than the
exponent of that power of $$a$$, which is equal
to $$c$$: so that $$c$$ being $$=a^b$$, $$b$$ is the logarithm of the power $$a^b$$.
If, for the present, we suppose $$b= 1$$, we have 1 for
the logarithm of $$a^1$$, and consequently $$\log a = 1$$; but if we
suppose $$b = 2$$, we have 2 for the logarithm of $$a^2$$; that is to
say, $$\log a^2 =2$$, and we may, in the same manner, obtain
$$\log a^3=3$$; $$\log a^4=4$$; $$\log a^5=5$$, and so on.

**222.** If we make $$b=0$$, it is evident that 0 will be the logarithm of $$a^0$$;
but $$a^0=1$$; consequently $$\log 1=0$$, whatever be the value of the root $$a$$.

Suppose $$b=-1$$, then -1 will be the logarithm of $$a^{-1}$$; but $$a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$$;
so that we have $$\log \frac{1}{a}=-1$$, and in the same manner,
we shall have $$\log \frac{1}{a^2} = -2$$; $$\log \frac{1}{a^3} = -3$$;
$$\log \frac{1}{a^4}=-4$$, etc.

**223.** It is evident, then, how we may represent the logarithms of all the powers of $$a$$, and
even those of fractions, which have unity for the numerator, and for the
denominator a power of $$a$$. We see also, that in all those cases the logarithms are integers;
but it must be observed, that if $$b$$ were a fraction, it would be the logarithm of an
irrational number: if we suppose, for example, $$b=\frac{1}{2}$$, it follows,
that $$\frac{1}{2}$$ is the logarithm of $$a^{1/2}$$,
or of $$\sqrt{a}$$; consequently we have also $$\log \sqrt{a}= \frac{1}{2}$$; and we shall find,
in the same manner, that $$\log \sqrt[3]{a} = \frac{1}{3}$$, $$\log \sqrt[4]{a} = \frac{1}{4}$$, etc.

**224.** But if it be required to find the logarithm of another
number $$c$$, it will be readily perceived, that it can neither
be an integer, nor a fraction; yet there must be such an exponent $$b$$, that
the power $$a^b$$ may become equal to the number proposed; we have therefore $$b \log c$$;
and generally, $$a^{\textrm{L}c} = c$$.

**225.** Let us now consider another number d, whose logarithm has been represented in a similar
manner by $$\log d$$; so that $$a^{\textrm{L}d} = d$$. Here if we multiply this expression by the
preceding one $$a^{\textrm{L}c} = c$$, we shall have
$$a^{\textrm{L}c+\textrm{L}d} =cd$$; hence, the exponent is always the logarithm of the power;
consequently,

$$\log c + \log d = \log cd.$$

But if, instead of multiplying, we divide the former expression by the latter,
we shall obtain a^{\textrm{L}c-\textrm{L}d}=\frac{c}{d};
and, consequently,

$$\log c — \log d = \log \frac{c}{d}.$$
