<span class="art">765</span> We have already shown how equations of the third
degree are resolved by the rule of Cardano; so that the principal object,
with regard to equations of the fourth degree,
is to reduce them to equations of the third degree. For it
is impossible to resolve, generally, equations of the fourth
degree, without the aid of those of the third; since, when
we have determined one of the roots, the others always
depend on an equation of the third degree. And hence
we may conclude, that the resolution of equations of higher
dimensions presupposes the resolution of all equations of lower
degrees.

<span class="art">766</span> It is now some centuries since Bombelli, an Italian,
gave a rule for this purpose, which we shall explain in this
chapter.

Let there be given the general equation of the fourth
degree,

$$x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0,$$

in which the letters $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, $$d$$, represent any possible numbers;
and let us suppose that this equation is the same as

$$\left(x^2+\frac{1}{2}ax+p\right)^2 - (qx+r)^2 = 0,$$

in which it is required to determine the letters $$p$$, $$q$$, $$r$$, in order that we may obtain
the equation proposed.
By squaring, and ordering this new equation, we shall have

$$
\begin{array}
x^4&+ax^3&+\frac{1}{4}a^2x^2&+apx&+p^2\\
&&2px^2&-2qrx&-r^2\\
&&-q^2x^2&&
\end{array}
$$

Now, the first two terms are already the same here as in the given equation;
the third term requires us to make

$$\frac{1}{4}a^2+2p-q^2=b,$$

which gives

$$q^2=\frac{1}{4}a^2+2p-b;$$

the fourth term shows that we must make $$ap-2qr=c$$,
or

$$2qr=ap-c;$$

and, lastly, we have for the last term $$p^2-r^2=d$$, or
$$r^2=p^2-d$$. We have therefore three equations which will give
the values of $$p$$, $$q$$, and $$r$$.
