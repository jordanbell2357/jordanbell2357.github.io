<span class="art">96</span> That which has been taught in the last chapter, cannot be completely performed, unless we are able to assign for
any number $$a$$, a number $$n$$, such that $$an^2+1$$ may become a square; or that we may have
$$m^2=an^2+1$$.

This equation would be easy to resolve, if we were satisfied with fractional numbers, since we should have only to
make $$m=1+\dfrac{np}{q}$$; for, by this supposition, we have

$$m^2=1+\dfrac{2np}{q}+\dfrac{n^2p^2}{q^2} = an^2+1;$$

in which equation, we
may expunge 1 from both sides, and divide the other terms
by $$n$$: then multiplying by $$q^2$$, we obtain $$2pq+np^2=anq^2$$;
and this equation, giving $$n=\dfrac{2pq}{aq^2-p^2}$$, would furnish an
infinite number of values for $$n$$: but as $$n$$ must be an integer
number, this method will be of no use, and therefore very
different means must be employed in order to accomplish
our object.

<span class="art">97</span> We must begin with observing, that if we wished
to have $$an^2+1$$ a square, in integer numbers, (whatever be
the value of $$a$$), the thing required would not be possible.

For, in the first place, it is necessary to exclude all the
cases, in which a would be negative; next, we must exclude
those also, in which $$a$$ would be itself a square; because
then $$an^2$$ would be a square, and no square can become a
square, in integer numbers, by being increased by unity. We
are obliged, therefore, to restrict our formula to the condition,
that $$a$$ be neither negative, nor a square;
but whenever $$a$$ is a positive number, without being a square, it is
possible to assign such an integer value of $$n$$, that $$an^2 + 1$$
may become a square: and when one such value has been
found, it will be easy to deduce from it an infinite number
of others, as was taught in the last chapter: but for our
purpose it is sufficient to know a single one, even the least;
and this, Pell, an English writer, has tauglit us to find bv
an ingenious method, which we shall here explain.
