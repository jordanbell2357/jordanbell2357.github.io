<span class="art">96</span> That which has been taught in the last chapter, cannot be completely performed, unless we are able to assign for
any number $$a$$, a number $$n$$, such that $$an^2+1$$ may become a square; or that we may have
$$m^2=an^2+1$$.

This equation would be easy to resolve, if we were satisfied with fractional numbers, since we should have only to
make $$m=1+\dfrac{np}{q}$$; for, by this supposition, we have

$$m^2=1+\dfrac{2np}{q}+\dfrac{n^2p^2}{q^2} = an^2+1;$$

in which equation, we
may expunge 1 from both sides, and divide the other terms
by $$n$$: then multiplying by $$q^2$$, we obtain $$2pq+np^2=anq^2$$;
and this equation, giving $$n=\dfrac{2pq}{aq^2-p^2}$$, would furnish an
infinite number of values for $$n$$: but as $$n$$ must be an integer
number, this method will be of no use, and therefore very
different means must be employed in order to accomplish
our object.
