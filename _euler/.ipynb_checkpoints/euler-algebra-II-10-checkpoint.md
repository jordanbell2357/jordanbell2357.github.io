### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section II. "Of the different Methods of calculating Compound Quantities." Chapter 10. "Of the higher Powers of Compound Quantities."

**340.** After squares and cubes, we must consider higher
powers, or powers of a greater number of degrees; which
are generally represented by exponents in the manner which
we before explained: we have only to remember, when the
root is compound, to enclose it in a parentheses: thus,
$$(a + b)^5$$ means that $$a + b$$ is raised to the fifth power, and
$$(a - b)^6$$ represents the sixth power of $$a - b$$, and so on.
We shall in this chapter explain the nature of these powers.

**341.** Let $$a + b$$ be the root, or the first power, and the
higher powers will be found, by multiplication, in the following manner:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
(a+b)^1=&a&+b&\\
&a&+b&\\
\hline
&a^2&+ab&\\
&&+ab&+b^2\\
\hline
(a+b)^2=&a^2&+2ab&+b^2
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
(a+b)^2=&a^2&+2ab&+b^2&\\
&a&+b&&\\
\hline
&a^3&+2a^2b&+ab^2&\\
&&+a^2b&+2ab^2&+b^3\\
\hline
(a+b)^3=&a^3&+3a^2b&+3ab^2&+b^3
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
(a+b)^3=&a^3&+3a^2b&+3ab^2&+b^3\\
&a&+b&&&\\
\hline
&a^4&+3a^3b&+3a^2b^2&+ab^3&\\
&&+a^3b&+3a^2b^2&+3ab^3&+b^4\\
\hline
(a+b)^4=&a^4&+4a^3b&+6a^2b^2&+4ab^3&+b^4
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
(a+b)^4=&a^4&+4a^3b&+6a^2b^2&+4ab^3&+b^4&\\
&a&+b&&&&\\
\hline
&a^5&+4a^4b&+6a^3b^2&+4a^2b^3&+ab^4&\\
&&+a^4b&+4a^3b^2&+6a^2b^3&+4ab^4&+b^5\\
\hline
(a+b)^5=&a^5&+5a^4b&+10a^3b^2&+10a^2b^3&+5ab^4&+b^5
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
(a+b)^5=&a^5&+5a^4b&+10a^3b^2&+10a^2b^3&+5ab^4&+b^5&\\
&a&+b&&&&&\\
\hline
&a^6&+5a^5b&+10a^4b^2&+10a^3b^3&+5a^2b^4&+ab^5&\\
&&+a^5b&+5a^4b^2&+10a^3b^3&+10a^2b^4&+5ab^5&+b^6\\
\hline
(a+b)^6=&a^6&+6a^5b&+15a^4b^2&+20a^3b^3&+15a^2b^4&+6ab^5&+b^6
\end{array}
$$

etc.

**342.** The powers of the root $$a - b$$ are found in the same
manner; and we shall immediately perceive that they do
not differ from the preceding, excepting that the 2nd, 4th,
6th, etc. terms are affected by the sign minus.

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
(a-b)^1=&a&-b&\\
&a&-b&\\
\hline
&a^2&-ab&\\
&&-ab&+b^2\\
\hline
(a-b)^2=&a^2&-2ab&+b^2
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
(a-b)^2=&a^2&-2ab&+b^2&\\
&a&-b&&\\
\hline
&a^3&-2a^2b&+ab^2&\\
&&-a^2b&+2ab^2&-b^3\\
\hline
(a-b)^3=&a^3&-3a^2b&+3ab^2&+b^3
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
(a-b)^3=&a^3&-3a^2b&+3ab^2&-b^3\\
&a&-b&&&\\
\hline
&a^4&-3a^3b&+3a^2b^2&-ab^3&\\
&&-a^3b&+3a^2b^2&-3ab^3&+b^4\\
\hline
(a-b)^4=&a^4&-4a^3b&+6a^2b^2&-4ab^3&+b^4
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
(a-b)^4=&a^4&-4a^3b&+6a^2b^2&-4ab^3&+b^4&\\
&a&-b&&&&\\
\hline
&a^5&-4a^4b&+6a^3b^2&-4a^2b^3&+ab^4&\\
&&-a^4b&+4a^3b^2&-6a^2b^3&+4ab^4&-b^5\\
\hline
(a-b)^5=&a^5&-5a^4b&+10a^3b^2&-10a^2b^3&+5ab^4&-b^5
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
(a-b)^5=&a^5&-5a^4b&+10a^3b^2&-10a^2b^3&+5ab^4&-b^5&\\
&a&-b&&&&&\\

\end{array}
$$

etc.

Here we see that all the odd powers of b have the sign
-, while the even powers retain the sign +. The reason
of this is evident; for since $$-b$$ is a term of the root, the
powers of tliat letter will ascend in the following series, $$-b$$,
$$+b^2$$, $$-b^3$$, $$+b^4$$, $$-b^5$$, $$+b^6$$, etc. which clearly
shows that the even powers must be affected by the sign +, and the
odd ones by the contrary sign -.

**343.** An important question occurs in this place ; namely,
how we may find, without being obliged to perform the same
calculation, all the powers either of $$a+b$$ or $$a-b$$.

We must remark, in the first place, that if we can assign
all the powers of $$a + b$$, those of $$a - b$$ are also found;
since we have only to change the signs of the even terms,
that is to say, of the second, the fourth, the sixth, etc.. The
business then is to establish a rule, by which any power of
$$a+b$$, however high, may be determined without the necessity
of calculating all the preceding powers.

**344.** Now, if from the powers which we have already determined
we take away the numbers that precede each term,
which are called the *coefficients*, we observe in all the terms
a singular order: first, we see the first term $$a$$ of the root
raised to the power which is required; in the following
terms, the powers of $$a$$ diminish continually by unity, and
the powers of $$b$$ increase in the same proportion; so that the
sum of the exponents of $$a$$ and of $$b$$ is always the same, and
always equal to the exponent of the power required; and,
lastly, we find the term $$b$$ by itself raised to the same power.
If therefore the tenth power of $$a + b$$ were required, we are
certain that the terms, without their coefficients, would succeed each other in the following order;

$$a^{10}, a^9 b, a^8b^2, a^7b^3, a^6b^4, a^5b^5, a^4b^6, a^3b^7, a^2b^8, ab^9, b^{10}.$$

**345.** It remains therefore to shew how we are to determine the coefficients,
which belong to those terms, or the
numbers by which they are to be multiplied. Now, with
respect to the first term, its coefficient is always unity; and,
as to the second, its coefficient is constantly the exponent of
the power. With regard to the other terms, it is not so
easy to observe any order in their coefficients; but, if we
continue those coefficients, we shall not fail to discover the
law by which they are formed; as will appear from the
following Table.
