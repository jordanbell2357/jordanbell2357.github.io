### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section III. "Of Ratios and Proportions." Chapter 7. "Of the Greatest Common Divisor of two given Numbers."

**451.** There are some numbers which have no other common divisor than unity;
and when the numerator and denominator of a fraction are of this nature,
it cannot be reduced to a more convenient form. The two numbers
48 and 35, for example, have no common divisor, though
each has its own divisors; for which reason, we cannot
express the relation 48:35 more simply, because the division
of two numbers by 1 does not diminish them.

**452.** But when the two numbers have a common divisor,
it is found, and even the greatest which they have, by the
following Rule:

Divide the greater of the two numbers by the less; next,
divide the preceding divisor by the remainder; what remains
in this second division will afterwards become a divisor for
a third division, in which the remainder of the preceding
divisor will be the dividend. We must continue this operation till
we arrive at a division that leaves no remainder;
and this last divisor will be the greatest common divisor of
the two given numbers.

</a>

Thus, for the two numbers 576 and 252.

So that, in this instance, the greatest common divisor is 36.

**453.** It will be proper to illustrate this rule by some other
examples ; and, for this purpose, let the greatest common
divisor of the numbers 504 and 312 be required.

<img src="/assets/euler/gjyncrpl.png" alt="Finding greatest common divisor with long division" width="500" height="83" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
</a>

So that 24 is the greatest common divisor, and consequently the relation 504:312
is reduced to the form 21:13.

**454.** Let the relation 625:529 be given, and the greatest
common divisor of these two numbers be required.

Wherefore 1 is, in this case, the greatest common divisor,
and consequently v\e cannot express the relation 625 : 529
b}' less numbers, nor reduce it to simpler terms.

**455.** It may be necessary, in this place, to give a demonstration of the foregoing Rule. In order to this, let a be
the greater, and b the less of the given numbers; and let d
he one of their common divisors ; it is evident that a and b
being divisible b}^ (!, we may also divide the quantities,
a — b, a — 26, a — 36, and, in general, a — nb by d.

**456.** Tlie converse is no less true : that is, if the numbers
b and a — nb are divisible by d, the number a Avill also be
divisible by d; foy nb being divisible by f7, we could not
divide a — nb hy d, if a were not also divisible by d.

**457. We observe farther, that if d be the greatest common
divisor of two numbers, b and a — nb, it will also be the
greatest common divisor of the two numbers a and b ; for if
a greater common divisor than d could be found for these
numbers a and 6, that number would also be a common
divisor of b and a — nb; and consequently d would not be
the greatest common divisor of these two numbers : but we
nAVQ supposed d the greatest divisor common to b and

a — nh ; therefore d imist also be tlie greatest common
divisor of a and b.

**458.** These things being laid down, let us divide, according to the rule, the greater number a by the less b ;
and let us suppose the quotient to be 7i ; tlien the remainder
will he a — nb, which must necessarily be less than b ; and
this remainder a — nb having the same greatest common
divisor with b, as the given numbers a and b, we have only
to repeat the division, dividing the preceding divisor b by
the remainder a — nb ; and the new remainder which we
obtain will still have, with the preceding divisor, the same
greatest common divisor, and soon.

**459.** We proceed, in the same manner, till we arrive at a
is nothing. Let therefore p be the last divisor, contained
exactly a certain number of times in its dividend ; this
dividend will evidently be divisible by p, and will have the
form mp ; so that the numbers p and mp are both divisible
by p : and it is also evident that they have no greater
common divisor, because no number can actually be divided by a number greater than itself; consequently, tiiis
last divisor is also the greatest common divisor of the given
numbers a and b.

**460.** We will now give another example of the same rule,
requiring the greatest common divisor of the numbers 1728
and 2304. The operation is as follows

Hence it follows that 57o is the greatest common divisor,
and that the relation 1728 : 2304 is reduced to 3 : 4; that
is to say, 1728 is to 2304 in the same relation as 3 is to 4.
