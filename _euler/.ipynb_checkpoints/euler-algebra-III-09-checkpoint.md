### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section III. "Of Ratios and Proportions." Chapter 9. "Observations on the Rules Proportion and their Utility."

<span class="art">477</span> This theory is so useful in the common occurrences
of life, that scarcely any person can do without it. There
is always a proportion between prices and commodities; and
when different kinds of money are the subject of exchange,
the whole consists in determining their mutual relations.
The examples furnished by these reflections will be very
proper for illustrating the principles of proportion, and
showing their utility by the application of them.

<span class="art">478</span> If we wished to know, for example, the relation
between two kinds of money; suppose a *Louis d'or* (L.) and
a *ducat* (D.): we must first know the value of those pieces when
compared with others of the same kind. Thus, a Louis d'or being,
at Berlin, worth 5 Reichsthaler and 8 Groschen,[^1] and
a ducat being worth 3 Reichsthaler, we may reduce these two
values to one denomination; either to Reichsthaler, which
gives the proportion

[^1]: 1 Reichsthaler (Rthl.) = 24 Groschen (Gr.).

1 L. : 1 D. = 5⅓ Rthl. : 3 Rthl. = 16:9;

or to Groschen, in which case we have

1 L. : 1 D. = 128:72 = 16:9,

which proportions evidently give the true relation of
the Louis d'or to the ducat; for the equality of the products
of the extremes and the means gives, in both cases,
9 Louis d'or = 16 ducats;
and, by means of this comparison, we may
change any sum of Louis d'or into ducats, and vice-versa.
Thus, suppose it were required to find how many ducats
there are in 1000 Louis d'or, we have this proportion:

9 L. : 1000 L. ∷ 16 D. : 1777⁷⁄₉ D.,

the number sought. If, on the contrary, it were required to find how many
Louis d'or there are in 1000 ducats, we have the following
proportion:

16 D. : 1000 D. ∷ 9 L. : 562½ L.,

the answer.

<span class="art">479</span> At St. Petersburg the value of the ducat varies, and
depends on the course of exchange; which course determines
the value of the ruble in Dutch stuivers, 105 of
which make a ducat. So that when the exchange is at 45
stuivers per ruble, we have this proportion

1 Rbl. : 1 D. = 45:105 = 3:7;

and hence this equality, 7 rubles = 3 ducats.

Hence again we shall find the value of a ducat in rubles;
for

3 D. : 7 Rbl. = 1 D. : 2⅓ Rbl.;

that is, 1 ducat is equal to 2⅓ rubles.

But if the exchange were at 50 stuivers, the proportion
would be,

1 Rbl. : 1 D. = 50:105 = 10:21;

which would give 21 rubles = 10 ducats; whence
1 ducat = 2⅒ rubles. Lastly, when the exchange is at 44 stuivers,
we have

1 Rbl. : 1 D. = 44:105,

and thus[^2]

[^2]: 1 ruble = 100 kopeks.

1 D. = 2¹⁷⁄₄₄ Rbl. = 2 Rbl. 38⁷⁄₁₁ kopeks.

<span class="art">480</span> It follows also from this, that we may compare different kinds of money,
which we have frequently occasion to do in bills of exchange.

Suppose, for example, that a person of St. Petersburg has
1000 rubles to be paid to him at Berlin, and that he wishes
to know the value of this sum in ducats at Berlin.

The exchange is at 47½; that is to say, one ruble makes
47½ stuivers; and in Holland, 20 stuivers make a Dutch guilder; 2½
guilder
make a Dutch rijksdaalder: also, the exchange of
Holland with Berlin is at 142; that is to say, for 100 Dutch
rijksdaalder, 142 Reichsthaler are paid at Berlin; and lastly, the ducat
is worth 3 Reichsthaler at Berlin.[^3]

[^3]: 1 rijksdaalder = 2½ guilder (fl.)

<span class="art">481</span> To resolve the question proposed, let us proceed
step by step. Beginning therefore with the stuivers, since
1 ruble = 47½ stuivers, or 2 rubles = 95 stuivers, we shall
have

2 Rbl. : 1000 Rbl. ∷ 95 st. : 47500 st.;

then again,

20 st. : 47500 st. ∷ 1 fl. : 2375 fl.

Also, since 2½ Dutch guilder = 1 Dutch rijksdaalder, or 5 Dutch guilder = 2 Dutch rijksdaalder;
we shall have

5 fl. : 2375 fl. ∷ 2 Dutch rijksdaalder : 950 Dutch rijksdaalder.

Then, taking the Reichsthaler of Berlin, according to the exchange, at 142, we shall have

100 Dutch rijksdaalder : 950 Dutch rijksdaalder ∷ 142 Rthl. : 1349 Rthl.

And lastly,

3 Rthl. : 1349 Rthl. ∷ 1 ducat : 449⅔ ducats,

which is the number sought.

<span class="art">482</span> Now, in order to render these calculations still more
complete, let us suppose that the Berlin banker refuses,
under some pretext or other, to pay this sum, and to accept
the bill of exchange without five per cent. discount; that is,
paying only 100 instead of 105. In that case, we must
make use of the following proportion:

105 : 100 ∷ 449⅔ : 428¹⁶⁄₆₃ ducats;

which is the answer under those conditions.

<span class="art">483</span> We have shewn that six operations are necessary in
making use of the *Rule of Three*; but we can greatly
abridge those calculations by a rule which is called the *Rule
of Reduction*, or *Double Rule of Three*. To explain which,
we shall first consider the two antecedents of each of the six
preceding operations:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1st</td>
    <td>2 rubles</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>95 stuivers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2nd</td>
    <td>20 stuivers</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>Dutch guilder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3rd</td>
    <td>5 Dutch guilder</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>2 Dutch rijksdaalder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4th</td>
    <td>100 Dutch rijksdaalder</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>142 Reichsthaler</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5th</td>
    <td>3 Reichsthaler</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>1 ducat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6th</td>
    <td>105 ducats</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>100 ducats</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If we now look over the preceding calculations, we shall
observe, that we have always multiplied the given sum by
the third terms, or second antecedents, and divided the
products by the first: it is evident, therefore, that we shall
arrive at tlie same results bv multiplying at once the sum
proposed by the product of all the third terms, and dividing
by the product of all the first terms: or, which amounts to
the same thing, that we have only to make the following
proportion: As the product of all the first terms, is to the
given number of rubles, so is the product of all the second
terms, to the number of ducats payable at Berlin.

<span class="art">484</span> This calculation is abridged still more, when
amongst the first terms some are found that have common
divisors with the second or third terms; for, in this case, we
destroy those terms, and substitute the quotient arising from
the division by that common divisor. The preceding example will,
in this manner, assume the following form.

$$(2\cdot 20\cdot 5\cdot 100\cdot 3\cdot 105) : 1000 :: (95\cdot 2\cdot 142\cdot 100) : \dfrac{1000\cdot 95\cdot 2\cdot 142\cdot 100}{2\cdot 20\cdot 5\cdot 100\cdot 3\cdot 105};$$

and after cancelling the common divisors in the numerator and denominator, this will become

$$\dfrac{10\cdot 19\cdot 142}{3\cdot 21} = \frac{26980}{63} = 428\frac{16}{63} \, \textrm{ducats},$$

as before.

485. The method which must be observed in using the
Rule of Reduction is this: we begin with the kind of money
in question, and compare it with another which is to begin
the next relation, in which we compare this second kind
with a third, and so on. Each relation, therefore, begins
with the same kind as the preceding relation ended with;
and the operation is continued till we arrive at the kind of
money which the answer requires; at the end of which we
must reckon the fractional remainders.

486. Let us give some other examples, in order to facilitate
the practice of this calculation.

If ducats gain at Hamburgh 1 per cent, on 2 Reichsthaler Banco
(that is to say, if 50 ducats are worth, not 100, but
101 Reichsthaler Banco), and if the exchange between Hamburg
and Konigsberg is 119 Groschen of Poland (that is, if 1
Reichsthaler Banco is equal to 119 Polish grosz), how many
Polish złoty are equivalent to 1000 ducats?[^4]

[^4]: 1 Polish złoty = 30 Polish grosz.

It being understood that 30 Polish grosz make 1
Polish złoty,
