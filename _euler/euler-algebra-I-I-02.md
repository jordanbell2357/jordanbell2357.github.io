<span class="art">8</span> When we have to add one given number to another,
this is indicated by the sign +, which is placed before the
second number, and is read **plus**. Thus 5 + 3 signifies
that we must add 3 to the number 5, in which case, every
one knows that the result is 8; in the same manner 12 + 7
make 19; 25 + 10 make 41; the sum of 25 + 41 is 66, etc.

<span class="art">9</span> We also make use of the same sign + plus, to connect several numbers together
for example, 7 + 5 + 9 signifies that to the number 7 we must add 5, and also 9,
which make 21. The reader will therefore understand what is meant by

8 + 5 + 13 + 11 + 1 + 3 + 10,

namely, the sum of all these numbers, which is 51.

<span class="art">10</span> All this is evident; and we have only to mention,
that in Algebra, in order to generalise numbers, we represent them by
letters, as $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, $$d$$, etc. Thus, the expression $$a + b$$, signifies
the sum of two numbers, which we express by $$a$$ and $$b$$, and these numbers may be either very
great, or very small. In the same manner, $$f+m+b+x$$,
signifies the sum of the numbers represented by these four
letters.

If we know therefore the numbers that are represented by
letters, we shall at all times be able to find, by arithmetic,
the sum or value of such expressions.

<span class="art">11</span> When it is required, on the contrary, to subtract one
given number from another, this operation is denoted by the
sign -, which signifies **minus**, and is placed before the
number to be subtracted: thus, 8 - 5 signifies that the
number 5 is to be taken from the number 8; which being done, there remain 3.
In like manner 12 - 7 is the same as 5; and 20 - 14 is the same as 6, etc.

<span class="art">12</span> Sometimes also we may have several numbers to
subtract from a single one ; as, for instance,

50 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9.

This signifies, first, take 1 from 50, and there
remain 49; take 3 from that remainder, and there will remain 46;
take away 5, and 41 remain; take away 7, and 34 remain; lastly,
from that take 9, and there remain 25:
this last remainder is the value of the expression. But as
the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, are all to be subtracted, it is the
same thing if we subtract their sum, which is 25, at once
from 50, and the remainder will be 25 as before.

<span class="art">13</span> It is also easy to determine the value of similar expressions,
in which both the signs + plus and - minus are found. For example; 
12 - 3 - 5 + 2 - 1 is the same as 5.

We have only to collect separately the sum of the numbers
that have the sign + before them, and subtract from it the
sum of those that have the sign -. Thus, the sum of 12
and 2 is 14; and that of 3, 5, and 1, is 9; hence 9 being
taken from 14, there remain 5.

<span class="art">14</span> It will be perceived, from these examples, that the
order in which we write the numbers is perfectly indifferent
and arbitrary, provided the proper sign of each be preserved.
We might with equal propriety have arranged the expression
in the preceding article thus;

12 + 2 - 5 - 3 - 1,

or

2 - 1 - 3 - 5 + 12,

or

2 + 12 -3 -1 -5,

or in still different orders; where it must be observed,
that in the arrangement first proposed, the sign + is supposed to be placed
before the number 12.

<span class="art">15</span> It will not be attended with any more difficulty if, in
order to generalise these operations, we make use of letters
instead of real numbers. It is evident, for example, that

$$a - b - c - d - e,$$

signifies that we have numbers expressed by $$a$$ and $$d$$, and
that from these numbers, or from their sum, we must subtract
the numbers expressed by the letters $$b$$, $$c$$, $$e$$, which
have before them the sign -.

<span class="art">16</span> Hence it is absolutely necessary to consider what sign
is prefixed to each number: for in Algebra, simple quantities are numbers considered
with regard to the signs which precede, or affect them. Farther, we call those **positive
quantities**, before which the sign + is found; and those
are called **negative quantities**, which are affected by the sign -.

<span class="art">17</span> The manner in which we generally calculate a person's property,
is an apt illustration of what has just been
said. For we denote what a man really possesses by positive
numbers, using, or understanding the sign +; whereas his
debts are represented by negative numbers, or by using the
sign -. Thus, when it is said of any one that he has 100
crowns, but owes 50, this means that his real possession
amounts to 100 - 50; or, which is the same thing,
+100-50, that is to say, 50.

<span class="art">18</span> Since negative numbers may be considered as debts,
because positive numbers represent real possessions, we
may say that negative numbers are less than nothing. Thus,
when a man has nothing of his own, and owes 50 crowns, it
is certain that he has 50 crowns less than nothing; for if
any one were to make him a present of 50 crowns to pay his
debts, he would still be only at the point nothing, though
really richer than before.

<span class="art">19</span> In the same manner, therefore, as positive numbers
are incontestably greater than nothing, negative numbers
are less than nothing. Now, we obtain positive numbers by
adding 1 to 0, that is to say, 1 to nothing; and by continuing always to increase thus from unity.
This is the origin of the series of numbers called natural numbers; the
following being the leading terms of this series:

0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7, +8, +9, +10,

and so on to infinity.

But if, instead of continuing this series by successive additions,
we continued it in the opposite direction, by perpetually subtracting unity,
we should have the following series of negative numbers:

0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10,

and so on to infinity.

<span class="art">20</span> All these numbers, whether positive or negative,
have the known appellation of whole numbers, or integers,
which consequently are either greater or less than nothing.
We call them integers, to distinguish them from fractions,
and from several other kinds of numbers, of which we shall
hereafter speak. For instance, 50 being greater by an entire
unit than 49, it is easy to comprehend that there may be,
between 49 and 50, an infinity of intermediate numbers, all
greater than 49, and yet all less than 50. We need only
imagine two lines, one 50 feet, the other 49 feet long, and it
is evident that an infinite number of lines may be drawn, all
longer than 49 feet, and yet shorter than 50.

<span class="art">21</span> It is of the utmost importance through the whole of
Algebra, that a precise idea should be formed of those negative quantities,
about which we have been speaking. I
shall, however, content myself with remarking here, that all
such expressions as

+1 - 1, +2 - 2, +3 - 3, +4 - 4, etc.

are equal to 0, or nothing. And that +2 - 5 is equal to -3:
for if a person has 2 crowns, and owes 5, he has not only
nothing, but still owes 3 crowns. In the same manner,
7 - 12 is equal to -5, and 25 - 40 is equal to -15.

<span class="art">22</span> The same observations hold true, when, to make the
expression more general, letters are used instead of numbers;
thus 0, or nothing, will always be the value of $$+a - a$$;
but if we wish to know the value of $$+a - b$$, two cases are
to be considered.

The first is when $$a$$ is greater than $$b$$; $$b$$ must then be
subtracted from $$a$$, and the remainder (before which is
placed, or understood to be placed, the sign +) shows the
value sought.

The second case is that in which $$a$$ is less than $$b$$: here $$a$$
is to be subtracted from $$b$$, and the remainder being made
negative, by placing before it the sign -, will be the value
sought.
