<span class="art">45</span> When a number is to be separated into two, three, or
more equal parts, it is done by means of division, which
enables us to determine the magnitude of one of those parts.
Wlien we wish, for example, to separate the number 12 into
three equal parts, we find by division that each of those
parts is equal to 4.

The following terms are made use of in this operation.
The number which is to be decompounded, or divided, is
called the **dividend**; the number of equal parts sought is
called the **divisor**; the magnitude of one of those parts,
determined by the division, is called the **quotient**: thus, in
the above example,

12 is the dividend, or the number to be divided,    
3 is the divisor, and  
4 is the quotient.

<span class="art">46</span> It follows from this, that if we divide a number by 2,
or into two equal parts, one of those parts, or the quotient,
taken twice, makes exactly the number proposed; and, in
the same manner, if we have a number to divide by 3, the
quotient taken thrice must give the same number again. In
general, the multiplication of the quotient by the divisor
must always reproduce the dividend.

<span class="art">47</span> It is for this reason that division is said to be a rule,
which teaches us to find a number or quotient, which, being multiplied by
the divisor, will exactly produce the dividend.
For example, if 35 is to be divided by 5, we seek for a
number which, multiplied by 5, will produce 35. Now,
this number is 7, since 5 times 7 is 35. The manner of
expression employed in this reasoning, is; 5 in 35 goes 7
times; and 5 times 7 makes 35.

<span class="art">48</span> The dividend therefore may be considered as a product,
of which one of the factors is the divisor, and the other the
quotient. Thus, supposing we have 63 to divide by 7, we
endeavour to find such a product, that, taking 7 for one of
its factors, the other factor multiplied by this may exactly
give 63. Now 7 · 9 is such a product, and consequently
it is the quotient obtained when we divide 63 by 7.

<span class="art">49</span> In general, if we have to divide a number $$ab$$ by $$a$$, it
is evident that the quotient will be $$b$$; for $$a$$ multiplied by $$b$$
gives the dividend $$ab$$. It is clear also, that if we had to
divide ab by b, the quotient would be a. And in all examples of division
that can be proposed, if we divide the
dividend by the quotient, we shall again obtain the divisor;
for as 24 divided by 4 gives 6, so 24 divided by 6 will
give 4.

<span class="art">50</span> As the whole operation consists in representing the
dividend by two factors, of which one may be equal to the
divisor, and the other to the quotient, the following examples
will be easily understood. I say first that the dividend $$abc$$,
divided by $$a$$, gives $$bc$$; for $$a$$, multiplied by $$bc$$,
produces $$abc$$: in the same manner $$abc$$, being divided by $$b$$,
we shall have $$ac$$; and $$abc$$, divided by $$ac$$, gives $$b$$. It is
also plain, that $$12mn$$, divided by $$3m$$, gives $$4n$$; for $$3m$$,
multiplied by $$4n$$, makes $$12mn$$. But if this same number
$$12mn$$ had been divided by 12, we should have obtained the
quotient $$mn$$.

<span class="art">51</span> Since every number a may be expressed by $$1a$$, or $$a$$,
it is evident that if we had to divide $$a$$, or $$1a$$, by 1, the
quotient would be the same number $$a$$. And, on the contrary, if the
same number $$a$$, or $$1a$$, is to be divided by $$a$$,
the quotient will be 1.

<span class="art">52</span> It often happens that we cannot represent the dividend as the product
of two factors, of which one is equal
to the divisor; hence, in this case, the division cannot be
performed in the manner we have described.

When we have, for example, 24 to divide by 7, it is at
first sight obvious, that the number 7 is not a factor of 24;
for the product of 7 · 3 is only 21, and consequently too
small; and 7 · 4 makes 28, which is greater than 24. We
discover, however, from this, that the quotient must be
greater than 3, and less than 4. In order therefore to
determine it exactly, we employ another species of numbers,
which are called fractions, and which we shall consider in
one of the following chapters.

<span class="art">53</span> Before we proceed to the use of fractions, it is usual
to be satisfied with the whole number which approaches
nearest to the true quotient, but at the same time paying
attention to the remamder which is left; thus we say, 7 in
24 goes 3 times, and the remainder is 3, because 3 times 7
produces only 21, which is 3 less than 24. We may also
consider the following examples in the same manner:

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/abfbqtug">
<img src="/EulerAlgebra/abfbqtug.png" alt="Long division" width="46" height="88">
</a>

that is to say, the divisor is 6, the dividend 84, the quotient 5, and the
remainder 4.

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/rhppibyu">
<img src="/EulerAlgebra/rhppibyu.png" alt="Long division" width="46" height="87">
</a>

here the divisor is 9, the dividend
41, the quotient 4, and the remainder 5.

The following rule is to be observed in examples where
there is a remainder.

<span class="art">54</span> Multiply the divisor by the quotient, and to the product add the remainder,
and the result will be the dividend.
This is the method of proving the division, and of discovering whether the calculation
is right or not. Thus, in
the first of the two last examples, if we multiply 6 by 5,
and to the product 30 add the remainder 4, we obtain 34,
or the dividend. And in the last example, if we multiply
the divisor 9 by the quotient 4, and to the product 36 add
the remainder 5, we obtain the dividend 41.

<span class="art">55</span> Lastly, it is necessary to remark here, with regard to
the signs + *plus* and - *minus*, that if we divide $$+ab$$ by
$$+a$$, the quotient will be $$+b$$, which is evident. But if we
divide $$+ab$$ by $$-a$$, the quotient will be $$-b$$; because
$$-a$$ multiplied with $$-b$$ gives $$+ab$$. If the dividend is $$-ab$$, and is to be
divided by the divisor $$+a$$, the quotient will be $$-b$$; because
it is $$-b$$ which, multiplied by $$+a$$, makes $$-ab$$. Lastly,
if we have to divide the dividend $$-ab$$ by the divisor $$-a$$,
the quotient will be $$+b$$; for the dividend $$-ab$$ is the
product of $$-a$$ by $$+b$$.

<span class="art">56</span> With regard, therefore, to the signs + and -, division requires
the same rules to be observed that we have
seen take place in multiplication; namely

\+ by + makes + ; + by - makes - ;  
\- by + makes - ; -by - makes + ;

or, in few words, like signs give *plus*, and unlike signs give
*minus*.

<span class="art">57</span> Thus, when we divide $$18pq$$ by $$-3p$$, the quotient is
$$-6q$$. Farther;

$$-30xy$$ divided by $$+6y$$ gives $$-5x$$, and  
$$-54abc$$ divided by $$-9b$$ gives $$+6ac$$;

for, in this last example, $$-9b$$ multiplied by $$+6ac$$ makes
$$-6 \cdot 9abc$$, or $$-54abc$$. But enough has been said on the
division of simple quantities; we shall therefore hasten to
the explanation of fractions, after having added some further
remarks on the nature of numbers, with respect to their
divisors.
