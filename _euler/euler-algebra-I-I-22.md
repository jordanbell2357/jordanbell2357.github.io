<span class="art">232</span> In those Tables, as we have already mentioned, we
begin with the supposition, that the root $$a$$ is = 10; so that
the logarithm of any number, $$c$$, is the exponent to which wc
must raise the number 10, in order that the power resulting
from it may be equal to the number $$c$$; or if we denote the
logarithm of $$c$$ by $$\textrm{L}c$$, we shall always have
$$10^{\textrm{L}c}=c$$.

<span class="art">233</span> We have already observed, that the logarithm of
the number 1 is always 0; and we have also
$$10^0=1$$; consequently, $$\log 1=0$$; $$\log 10=1$$;
$$\log 100=2$$; $$\log 1000=3$$; $$\log 10000=4$$;
$$\log 100000=5$$; $$\log 1000000=6$$.
Farther, $$\log \frac{1}{10}=-1$$; $$\log \frac{1}{100}=-2$$;
$$\log \frac{1}{1000}=-3$$; $$\log \frac{1}{10000}=-4$$;
$$\log \frac{1}{100000}=-5$$; $$\log \frac{1}{1000000}=-6$$.

<span class="art">234</span> The logarithms of the principal numbers, therefore,
are easily determined; but it is much more difficult to find
the logarithms of all the other intervening numbers; and
yet they must be inserted in the Tables. This however is
not the place to lay down all the rules that are necessary for
such an inquiry; we shall therefore at present content ourselves with a general view only of the subject.

<span class="art">235</span> First, since $$\log 1=0$$, and $$\log 10 = 1$$, it is evident
that the logarithms of all numbers between 1 and 10 must be
included between and unity; and, consequently, be greater
than 0, and less than 1. It will therefore be sufficient to
consider the single number 2; the logarithm of which is
certainly greater than 0, but less than unity:
and if we represent this logarithm by the letter $$x$$, so that
$$\log 2 = x$$, the
value of that letter must be such as to give exactly $$10^x = 2$$.

We easily perceive, also, that $$x$$ must be considerably
less than ½, or which amounts to the same thing,
$$10^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ is greater than 2; for if we square both sides,
the square of
$$10^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ equals 10,
and the square of 2 equals 4. Now, this latter is
much less than the former: and, in the same manner, we
see that $$x$$ is also less than ⅓; that is to say,
$$10^{\frac{1}{3}}$$ is greater
than 2: for the cube of $$10^{\frac{1}{3}}$$ is 10,
and that of 2 is only 8.
But, on the contrary, by making $$x = \frac{1}{4}$$,
we give it too small
a value; because the fourth power of $$10^{\frac{1}{4}}$$
being 10, and
that of 2 being 16, it is evident that $$10^{\frac{1}{4}}$$
is less than 2.
Thus, we see that $$x$$, or $$\log 2$$, is less than ⅓,
but greater than ¼: and, in the same manner, we may determine,
with respect to every fraction contained between ¼ and ⅓,
whether it be too great or too small.

In making trial, for example, with ²⁄₇, which is less than ⅓,
and greater than ¼, $$10^x$$, or $$10^{\frac{1}{2}}$$,
ought to be = 2; or the
seventh power of $$10^{\frac{2}{7}}$$, that is to say,
$$10^2$$ or 100, ought to
be equal to the seventh power of 2, or 128;
which is consequently greater than 100. We see, therefore,
that ²⁄₇ is less than $$\log 2$$, and that $$\log 2$$,
which was found less than
⅓, is however greater than ²⁄₇.

Let us try another fraction, which, in consequence of
what we have already found, ,ust be contained between ²⁄₇
and ⅓. Such a fraction between these limits is ³⁄₁₀; and it is
therefore required to find whether
$$10^{\frac{3}{10}} = 2$$; if this be the
case, the tenth powers of those numbers are also equal:
but
the tenth power of $$10^{\frac{3}{10}}$$ is $$10^3 = 1000$$,
and the tenth power
of 2 is 1024; we conclude therefore, that $$10^{\frac{3}{10}}$$
is less than
2, and, consequently, that ³⁄₁₀ is too small a fraction, and
therefore the $$\log 2$$, though less than ⅓,
is yet greater
than ³⁄₁₀.

<span class="art">236</span> This discussion serves to prove, that $$\log 2$$ has a
determinate value, since we know that it is certainly greater
than ³⁄₁₀, but less than ⅓; we shall not however proceed any
farther in this investigation at present. Being therefore still
ignorant of its true value, we shall represent it by $$x$$, so that
$$\log 2=x$$; and endeavour to show how, if it were known,
we could deduce from it the logarithms of an infinity of
other numbers. For this purpose, we shall make use of
the equation already mentioned, namely,

$$\log cd = \log c + \log d,$$

which comprehends the property, that the logarithm
of a product is found by adding together the logarithms of
the factors.

<span class="art">237</span> First, as $$\log 2=x$$, and $$\log 10=1$$, we shall have

<table>
<tr>
<td>\(\log 20=x+1\)</td>
<td>\(\log 200=x+2\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(\log 2000=x+3\)</td>
<td>\(\log 20000=x+4\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(\log 200000=x+2\)</td>
<td>\(\log 2000000=x+6\), etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>
