<span class="art">63</span> As our general formula is composed of three terms,
we shall observe, in the first place, that it may always be
transformed into another, in which the middle term is wanting.
This is done by supposing $$x=\dfrac{y-b}{2c}$$;
which substitution changes the formula into

$$a+\dfrac{by-b^2}{2c} + \dfrac{y^2-2by+b^2}{4c};
\quad \textrm{or} \quad \dfrac{4ac-b^2+y^2}{4c};$$

and since this must be a square, let us make it equal to $$\dfrac{z^2}{4}$$, we shall
then have

$$4ac-b^2+y^2=\dfrac{4cz^2}{4}=cz^2,$$

and, consequently, $$y^2 = cz^2 + b^2 - 4ac$$. Whenever, therefore, our formula
is a square, this last $$cz^2+b^2-4ac$$ will be so likewise;
and reciprocally, if this be a square, the proposed formula will be a square also.
If therefore we write $$t$$, instead of $$b^2-4ac$$, the whole will be reduced
to determining whether a quantity of the form $$cz^2+t$$ can become a square or not.
And as this formula consists only of two terms, it is certainly much
easier to judge from that whether it be possible or not; but in
any further inquiry we must be guided by the nature of the given numbers
$$c$$ and $$t$$.

<span class="art">64</span> It is evident that if $$t = 0$$, the formula $$cz^2$$ can become
a square only when $$c$$ is a square; for the quotient arising
from the division of a square by another square being likewise a square,
the quantity $$cz^2$$ cannot be a square, unless $$\dfrac{cz^2}{z^2}$$, that is to say,
$$c$$, be one. So that when $$c$$ is not a square,
the formula $$cz^2$$ can by no means become a square; and on the
contrary, if $$c$$ be itself a square, $$cz^2$$ will also be a square,
whatever number be assumed for $$z$$.
