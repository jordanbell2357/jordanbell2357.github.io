<span class="art">63</span> As our general formula is composed of three terms,
we shall observe, in the first place, that it may always be
transformed into another, in which the middle term is wanting.
This is done by supposing $$x=\dfrac{y-b}{2c}$$;
which substitution changes the formula into

$$a+\dfrac{by-b^2}{2c} + \dfrac{y^2-2by+b^2}{4c};
\quad \textrm{or} \quad \dfrac{4ac-b^2+y^2}{4c};$$

and since this must be a square, let us make it equal to $$\dfrac{z^2}{4}$$, we shall
then have

$$4ac-b^2+y^2=\dfrac{4cz^2}{4}=cz^2,$$

and, consequently, $$y^2 = cz^2 + b^2 - 4ac$$. Whenever, therefore, our formula
is a square, this last $$cz^2+b^2-4ac$$ will be so likewise;
and reciprocally, if this be a square, the proposed formula will be a square also.
If therefore we write $$t$$, instead of $$b^2-4ac$$, the whole will be reduced
to determining whether a quantity of the form $$cz^2+t$$ can become a square or not.
And as this formula consists only of two terms, it is certainly much
easier to judge from that whether it be possible or not; but in
any further inquiry we must be guided by the nature of the given numbers
$$c$$ and $$t$$.

<span class="art">64</span> It is evident that if $$t = 0$$, the formula $$cz^2$$ can become
a square only when $$c$$ is a square; for the quotient arising
from the division of a square by another square being likewise a square,
the quantity $$cz^2$$ cannot be a square, unless $$\dfrac{cz^2}{z^2}$$, that is to say,
$$c$$, be one. So that when $$c$$ is not a square,
the formula $$cz^2$$ can by no means become a square; and on the
contrary, if $$c$$ be itself a square, $$cz^2$$ will also be a square,
whatever number be assumed for $$z$$.

<span class="art">65</span> If we wish to consider other cases, we must have recourse to what has been already said on the subject of different kinds of numbers, considered with relation to theirdivision by other numbers.

We have seen, for example, that the divisor 3 produces
three different kinds of numbers. The first comprehends
the numbers which are divisible by 3, and may be expressed
by the formula $$3n$$.

The second kind comprehends the numbers which, being
divided by 3, leave the remainder 1, and are contained in
the formula $$3n+1$$.

To the third class belong numbers which, being divided
by 3, leave 2 for the remainder, and which may be represented
by the general expression $$3n+2$$.

Now, since all numbers are comprehended in these three
formulae, let us therefore consider their squares. First, if
the question relate to a number included in the formula $$3u$$,
we see that the square of this quantity being $$9n^2$$, it is divisible
not only by 3, but also by 9.

If the given number be included in the formula $$3n+1$$,
we have the square $$9n^2+6n+1$$, which, divided by 3, gives
$$3n^2+2n$$, with the remainder 1; and which, consequently, belongs to
the second class, $$3n+1$$. Lastly, if the number in question be included
in the formula $$3n+2$$,
we have to consider the square $$9n^2+12n+4$$; and if we divide it by 3,
we obtain $$3n^2+4n+1$$, and the remainder 1; so that this square belongs,
as well as the former, to the class $$3n+1$$.

Hence it is obvious, that square numbers are only of two
kinds with relation to the number 3; for they are either
divisible by 3, and in this case are necessarily divisible also
by 9; or they are not divisible by 3, in which case the remainder is always 1,
and never 2; for which reason, no
number contained in the formula $$3n+2$$ can be a square.
