<span class="art">24</span> In the preceding chapter, we have seen how, by means
of a single equation, two unknown quantities may be determined,
so far as to express them in integer and positive
numbers. If, therefore, we had two equations, in order that
the question may be indeterminate, those equations must
contain more than two unknown quantities. Questions of
this kind occur in the common books of arithmetic; and are
resolved by the rule called **Regula Coeci**, or **The Rule of False Position**;
the foundation of which we shall now explain, beginning with the following example:

<span class="art">25</span> *Question 1.* Thirty persons, men, wbmen, and children, spend 50 crowns in a tavern;
the share of a man is 3 crowns, that of a woman 2 crowns, and that of a child is 1
crown; how many persons were there of each class?

If the number of men be $$p$$, of women $$q$$, and of children $$r$$,
we shall have the two following equations;

1. $$p+q+r=30$$, and
2. $$3p+2q+r=50$$,

from which it is required to find the value of the three letters $$p$$, $$q$$,
$$r$$, in integer and positive numbers. The first equation gives
$$r=30-p-q$$; whence we immediately conclude that $$p+q$$ must be less than 30;
and, substituting this value of $$r$$ in the second equation, we have
$$2p+q+30=50$$; so that $$q=20-2p$$, and $$p+q=20-p$$, which evidently is
also less than 30. Now, as we may, in this equation, assume all numbers for $$p$$
which do not exceed 10, we shall have the following eleven answers:
the number of men $$p$$, of women $$q$$, and of children $$r$$, being as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<td>\(p\) = </td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(q\) =</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(r\) =</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
</table>

and, if we omit the first and the last, there will remain 9.

<span class="art">26</span> *Question 2.* A certain person buys hogs, goats, and sheep, to the number of 100, for 100 crowns;
the hogs cost him 3½ crowns apiece; the goats, 1⅓ crown; and the sheep, ½ a crown. How many had he of each?

Let the number of hogs be $$p$$, that of the goats $$q$$, and of
the sheep $$r$$, then we shall have the two following equations:

1. $$p+q+r=100$$,
2. $$3½ p + 1⅓ q + ½ r-100$$;

the latter of which being multiplied by 6, in order to remove
the fractions, becomes,
$$21p+8q+3r=600$$.
Now, the first gives $$r=100-p-q$$; and if we substitute this value of $$r$$ in the second,
we have $$18p+5q=300$$, or $$5q=300-18p$$, and $$q=60-\dfrac{18p}{5}$$: consequently,
$$18p$$ must be divisible by 5, and therefore, as 18 is not divisible by 5, $$p$$ must contain
5 as a factor. If we therefore make $$p=5s$$, we obtain $$q=60-18s$$, and $$r=13s+40$$;
in which we may assume for the value of $$s$$ any integer number
whatever, provided it be such, that $$q$$ does not become negative: but this condition
limits the value of $$s$$ to 3; so that
if we also exclude 0, there can only be three answers to the
question; which are as follow:

<table>
<tr>
<td class="underline">When \(s\) =</td>
<td class="underline">1</td>
<td class="underline">2</td>
<td class="underline">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We have \(p\) =</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(q\) =</td>
<td>42</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(r\) =</td>
<td>53</td>
<td>66</td>
<td>79</td>
</tr>
</table>
