<span class="art">256</span> When two or more expressions, consisting of several
terms, are to be added together, the operation is frequently
represented merely by signs, placing each expression between two parentheses, and connecting it with the rest by
means of the sign +. Thus, for example, if it be required,
to add the expressions $$a+b+c$$ and $$d+e+f$$, we represent the sum by

$$(a+b+c)+(d+e+f).$$

<span class="art">257</span> It is evident that this is not to perform addition,
but only to represent it. We see, however, at the same
time, that in order to perform it actually, we have onlv to
leave out the parentheses; for as the number $$d+e+f$$ is
to be added to $$a+b+c$$, we know that this is done by
joining to it first $$+d$$, then $$+e$$, and then $$+f$$; which therefore
gives the sum

$$a+b+c+d+e+f;$$

and the same method
is to be observed, if any of the terms are affected by the
sign -; as they must be connected in the same way, by means of their proper sign.

<span class="art">258</span> To make this more evident, we shall consider an
example in pure numbers, proposing to add the expression
15 - 6 to 12 - 8. Here, if we begin by adding 15, we
shall have 12 - 8 + 15; but this is adding too much, since
we had only to add 15 - 6, and it is evident that 6 is the
number which we have added too much; let us therefore
take this 6 away by writing it with the negative sign, and
we shall have the true sum,

12 - 8 + 15 - 6;

which shows that the sums are found by writing all the
terms, each with its proper sign.

<span class="art">259</span> If it were required therefore to add the expression
$$d-e+f$$ to $$a-b+c$$, we should express the sum thus,

$$a-b+c+d-e-f;$$

remarking, however, that it is of no consequence in what
order we write these terms; for their places may be changed
at pleasure, provided their signs be preserved; so that this
sum might have been written thus,

$$c-e+a-f+d-b.$$

<span class="art">260</span> It is evident, therefore, that addition is attended with no difficulty,
whatever be the form of the terms to be added: thus, if it were necessary to add
together the expressions
$$2a^3+6\surd b-4\log c$$ and $$5 \sqrt[5]{\vphantom{a}} a-7c$$, we should write them

$$2a^3+6\surd b-4\log c+5 \sqrt[5]{\vphantom{a}} a-7c,$$

either in this or in any other order of the terms; for if the
signs are not changed, the sum will always be the same.

<span class="art">261</span> But it frequently happens that the sums represented in this manner may be
considerably abridged, as is the case when two or more terms destroy each other;
for example, if we find in the same sum the terms $$+a-a$$, or $$3a-4a+a$$: or when
two or more terms may be reduced to one, etc. Thus, in the following examples

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
3a+2a=5a,&7b-3b=+4b,&-6c+10c=+4c,\\
5a-8a=-3a,&-7b+b=-6b,&-3c-4c=-7c,\\
2a-5a+a=-2a,&-3b-5b+2b=-6b.&
\end{array}
$$

Whenever two or more terms, therefore, are entirely the
same with regard to letters, their sum may be abridged;
but those cases must not be confounded with such as these,
$$2a^2 + 3a$$, or $$2b^3 - b^4$$, which admit of no abridgment.

<span class="art">262</span> Let us consider now some other examples of reduction, as the following,
which will lead us immediately to an important truth. Suppose it were required to
add together the expressions $$a+b$$ and $$a-b$$; our rule gives $$a+b+a-b$$;
now $$a + a = 2a$$, and $$b-b=0$$; the sum therefore is $$2a$$: consequently,
if we add together the sum of two numbers $$(a + b)$$ and their difference
$$(a - b)$$, we obtain the double of the greater of those two numbers.

This will be better understood perhaps from the following examples:

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
3a&-2b&-c\\
5b&-6c&+a\\
\hline
4a&+3b&-7c
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
a^3&-2a^2b&+2ab^2&\\
&-a^2b&+2ab^2&-b^3\\
\hline
a^3&-3a^2b&+4ab^2&-b^3.
\end{array}
$$
