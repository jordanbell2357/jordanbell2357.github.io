<span class="art">773</span> The rule of Bombelli, as we have seen, resolves
siuations of the fourth degree by means of an equation of
the third degree; but since the invention of that Rule,
another method has been discovered of performing the same
resolution: and, as it is altogether different from the first, it
deserves to be separately explained.

<span class="art">774</span> We suppose that the root of an equation of the
fourth degree has the form,

$$x=\surd p + \surd q + \surd r,$$

in which the letters $$p$$, $$q$$, $$r$$, express
the roots of an equation of the third degree, $$z^3-fz^2+gz-h=0$$;
so that $$p+q+r=f$$;
$$pq+pr+qr=g$$;
and $$pqr=h$$. This being laid down, we square the assumed
formula, $$x=\surd p + \surd q + \surd r$$, and we obtain

$$x^2=p+q+r+2\surd pq + 2 \surd pr + 2 \surd qr;$$

and, since $$p+q+r=f$$, we have

$$x^2-f=2\surd pq+2\surd pr+2\surd qr;$$

we again take the squares, and find

$$x^4-2fx^2+f^2=4pq+4pr+4qr+8\surd (p^2qr) + 8 \surd(pq^2r)+8\surd(pqr^2).$$

Now, $$4pq+4pr+4qr=4g$$; so that the equation becomes

$$x^4-2fx^2+f^2-4g=8\surd(pqr)\cdot (\surd p+\surd q+\surd r);$$

but $$\surd p + \surd q + \surd r = x$$, and $$pqr=h$$, or $$\surd(pqr)=\surd h$$;
wherefore we arrive at this equation of the fourth degree,

$$x^4-2fx^2-8x\surd h + f^2-4g=0,$$

one of the roots of which is $$x=\surd p+\surd q+\surd r$$; and in which
$$p$$, $$q$$, and $$r$$, are the roots of an equation of the third
degree,

$$z^3-fz^2+gz-h=0.$$

<span class="art">775</span> The equation of the fourth degree, at which we
have arrived, may be considered as general, although the
second term $$x^2y$$ is wanting; for we shall afterwards show,
that every complete equation may be transformed into another,
from which the second term has been taken away.

Let there be proposed the equation $$x^4-ax^2-bx-c=0$$,
in order to determine its root. This we must first compare
with the formula, in order to obtain the values of $$f$$, $$g$$,
and $$h$$; and we shall have,

1. $$2f=a$$, and, consequently, $$f=\dfrac{a}{2}$$;
2. $$8\surd h=b$$, so that $$h=\dfrac{b^2}{64}$$;
3. $$f^2-4g=-c$$, or $$\dfrac{a^2}{4}-4g+c=0$$,

or $$\frac{1}{4}a^2+c=4g$$; consequently, $$g=\frac{1}{16}a^2+\frac{1}{4}c$$.

<span class="art">776</span> Since, therefore, the equation

$$x^4-ax^2-bx-c=0,$$

gives the values of the letters $$f$$, $$g$$, and $$h$$, so that

$$f=\frac{1}{2}a, \quad g = \frac{1}{16}a^2+\frac{1}{4}c,\quad
\textrm{and} \quad h=\frac{1}{64}b^2,\quad
\textrm{or} \quad \surd h=\frac{1}{8}b,$$

we form from these values the equation of the third degree
$$z^3-fz^2+gz-h=0$$, in order to obtain its roots by
the known rule. And if we suppose those roots, first, $$z=p$$,
second, $$z=q$$, third, $$z=r$$, one of the roots of our equation
of the fourth degree must be, by the supposition, <span class="artref">Art. 774</span>,

$$x=\surd p+\surd q+\surd r.$$
