**152.** When a number has been multiplied twice by itself,
or, which is the same thing, when the square of a number
has been multiplied once more by that number, we obtain
a product which is called a cube, or a cubic number. Thus,
the cube of $$a$$ is $$aaa$$, since it is the product obtained by
multiplying $$a$$ by itself, or by $$a$$, and that square $$aa$$ again
by $$a$$.

The cubes of the natural numbers, therefore, succeed
each other. in the followinsf order

**153.** If we consider the differences of those cubes, as we
did of the squares, by subtracting each cube from that
which comes after it, we obtain the following series of
numbers:

7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271.

Where we do not at first observe any regularity in them ;
but if we take the respective differences of these numbers, we
find the following series:

12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60;

in which the terms, it is evident, increase always by 6.

**154.** After the definition we have given of a cube, it will
not be difficult to find the cubes of fractional numbers;
thus, ⅛ the cube of ½; ¹⁄₂₇ is the cube of ⅓; and ⁸⁄₂₇ is the
cube of ⅔. In the same manner, we have only to take the
cube of the numerator and that of the denominator separately,
and we shall have ²⁷⁄₆₄ for the cube of ¾.

**155.** If it be required to find the cube of a mixed number, we must first reduce it to a single fraction, and then
proceed in the manner that has been described. To find,
for example, the cube of li, we must take that of \, which
