540. We are accustomed to express the interest of any
principal by i^er cents, signifying how much interest is annually paid lor the sum of 100 pounds. And it is very
usual to put out the principal sum at 5 per cent, that is, on
such terms, that we receive 5 pounds interest for every 100
pounds principal. Nothing therefore is more easy than to
calculate the interest for any sum ; for we have only to say,
according to the Rule of Three

As 100 is to the principal proposed, so is the rate per
cent to the interest required. Let the principal, for example, be 860/., its annual interest is found by this proportion ;


Therefore 43/. is the annual interest.

541. We shall not dwell any longer on examples of
Simple Interest, but pass on immediately to the calculation
of Compound Interest; where the chief subject of inquiry
is, to what sum does a given principal amount, after a
certain number of years, the interest being annually added
to the principal. In order to resolve this question, we begin
with the consideration, that 100/. placed out at 5 per cent,
becomes, at the end of a year, a principal of 105/. : therefore
let the principal be a ; its amount, at the end of the year,
will be found, by saying ; As 100 is to «, so is 105 to the
answer ; which gives
