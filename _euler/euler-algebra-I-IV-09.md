<span class="art">689</span> What we have already said sufficiently shows,
that equations of the second degree admit of two solutions; and this property ought
to be examined in every
point of view, because the nature of equations of a higher
degree will be very much illustrated by such an examination. We shall therefore retrace,
with more attention,
the reasons which render an equation of the second degree
capable of a double solution; since they undoubtedly will
exhibit an essential property of those equations. 

<span class="art">690</span> We have already seen, indeed, that this double
solution arises from the circumstance that the square root
of any number may be taken either positively, or negatively; but, as this principle will
not easily apply to
equations of higher degrees, it may be proper to illustrate
it by a distinct analysis. Taking, therefore, for an
example, the quadratic equation, $$x^2= 12x-35$$, we shall
give a new reason for this equation being resolvible in
two ways, by admitting for $$x$$ the values 5 and 7, both of
which will satisfy the terms of the equation.

<span class="art">691</span> For this purpose it is most convenient to begin
with transposing the terms of the equation, so that one of
the sides may become 0; the above equation consequently
takes the form
$$x^2-12x+35=0$$;
and it is now required to find a number such, that, if we
substitute it for $$x$$, the quantity $$x^2 -12x + 35$$ may be really
equal to nothing; after which, we shall have to show how
this may be done in two different ways. 

<span class="art">692</span> Now, the whole of this consists in clearly showing,
that a quantity of the form $$x^2 -12x + 35$$ may be considered
as the product of two factors. Thus, in reality, the
quantity of which we speak is composed of the two factors
$$(x - 5) \cdot (x - 7)$$; and since the above quantity must
become 0, we must also have the product $$(x-5) \cdot (x-7) = 0$$;
but a product, of whatever number of factors it is
composed, becomes equal to 0, only when one of those
factors is reduced to 0. This is a fundamental principle,
to which we must pay particular attention, especially
when equations of higher degrees are treated of.

<span class="art">693</span> It is therefore easily understood, that the product
$$(x - 5) \cdot (x - 7)$$ may become 0 in two ways: first, when
the first factor $$x-5 = 0$$; and also, when the second factor
$$x-7=0$$. In the first case, $$x=5$$, in the second $$x=7$$.
The reason is therefore very evident, why such an equation
$$x^2-12x+35=0$$, admits of two solutions; that is to
say, why we can assign two values of $$x$$, both of which
equally satisfy the terms of the equation; for it depends
upon this fundamental principle, that the quantity $$x^2 -12x + 35$$
may be represented by the product of two
factors.

<span class="art">694</span> The same circumstances are found in all equations
of the second degree: for, after having brought the terms
to one side, we find an equation of the following form
$$x^2 -ax+ b=0$$, and this formula may be always considered
as the product of two factors, which we shall represent by
$$(x-p)(x-q)$$, without considering what numbers the
letters $$p$$ and $$q$$ represent, or whether they be negative or
positive. Now, this product must be $$= 0$$, from the
nature of our equation, it is evident that this may happen
in two cases; in the first place, when $$x= p$$; and in the
second place, when $$x=q$$; and these are the two values of
$$x$$ which satisfy the terms of the equation,

<span class="art">695</span> Let us here consider the nature of these two
factors, in order that the multiplication of the one by
the other may exactly produce $$x^2 -ax+ b$$. By actually
multiplying them, we obtain $$x^2 -( p + q)x + pq$$; which
quantity must be the same as $$x^2 -ax+ b$$, therefore we have
evidently $$p+q=a$$, and $$pq=b$$. Hence is deduced this
very remarkable property; that in every equation of the
form $$x^2 -ax + b=0$$, the two values of $$x$$ are such, that
their sum is equal to $$a$$, and their product equal to $$b$$: it
therefore necessarilv follows, that, if we know one of the
values, the other is easily found. 

<span class="art">696</span> We have at present considered the case, in which
the two values of $$x$$ are positive, and which requires the
second term of the equation to have the sign -, and the
third term to have the sign +. Let us also consider
the cases, in which either one or both values of $$x$$ become
negative. The first takes place, when the two factors of
the equation give a product of this form, $$(x-p) (x+q)$$;
for then the two values of $$x$$ are $$x = p$$, and $$x = - q$$; and
the equation itself becomes $$x^2 +(q-p)x-pq=0$$;
the second term having the sign + when $$q$$ is greater
than $$p$$, and the sign - when $$q$$ is less than $$p$$; lastly, the
third term is always negative.

The second case, in which both values of $$x$$ are negative,
occurs when the two factors are $$(x+p) (x+q)$$;
for we shall then have $$x= -p$$, and $$x= -q$$; the equation
itself therefore becomes $$x^2+(p +q)x+pq=0$$.
in which both the second and third terms are affected by
the sign +.

<span class="art">697</span> The signs of the second and the third terms consequently show us the nature of the
roots of any equation
of the second degree. For let the equation be
$$x^2 \dots ax \dots b=0$$. If the second and third terms have the sign +,
the two values of $$x$$ are both negative; if the second term
have the sign -, and the third term +, both values are
positive: lastly, if the third term also have the sign -,
one of the values in question is positive. But, in all cases
whatever, the second term contains the *sum* of the two
values, and the third term contains their *product*. 

<span class="art">698</span> After what has been said, it will be easy to form
equations of the second degree containing any two given
values. Let there be required, for example, an equation
such, that one of the values of $$x$$ may be 7, and the other
-3. We first form the simple equations $$x=7$$, and
$$x= -3$$; whence, $$x-7=0$$, and $$x+3=0$$; these give us
the factors of the equation required, which consequently
becomes $$x^2 -4x-21 =0$$. Applying here, also, the above
rule, we find the two given values of $$x$$; for if $$x^2=4x+21$$,
we have, by completing the square, etc. $$x=2 \pm \surd 25 =2  \pm 5$$;
that is to say, $$x=7$$, or $$x= -3$$. 

<span class="art">699</span> The values of $$x$$ may also happen to be equal. Suppose, for example, that an
equation is required, in which
both values may be 5. Here the two factors will be $$(x-5) (x-5)$$,
and the equation sought will be $$x^2 - 10x + 25=0$$.
In this equation, $$x$$ appears to have only one value; but it
is because $$x$$ is twice found $$= 5$$, as the common method of
resolution shows; for we have $$x^2= 10x-25$$; wherefore
$$x=5\pm \surd 0 = 5 \pm 0$$, that is to say, $$x$$ is in two ways $$= 5$$. 

<span class="art">700</span> A very remarkable case sometimes occurs, in which
both values of $$x$$ become
imaginary, or impossible; and it is
then wholly impossible to assign any value for $$x$$, that would
satisfy the terms of the equation. Let it be proposed, for
example, to divide the number 10 into two parts, such
that their product may be 30. If we call one of those
parts $$x$$, the other will be $$10-x$$, and their product will be
$$10x-x^2=30$$; wherefore $$x^2= 10x-30$$, and $$x=5 \pm \surd -5$$,
which, being an imaginary number, shows that the question is impossible. 

<span class="art">701</span> It is very important, therefore, to discover some
sign, by means of which we may immediately know whether
an equation of the second degree be possible or not.

Let us resume the general equation $$x^2 -ax+b=0$$. We
shall have $$x^2=ax - b$$, and $$x =\frac{1}{2}a \pm \surd\left(\frac{1}{4}a^2-b\right)$$. This
shows, that if $$b$$ be greater than $$\frac{1}{4}a^2$$, or $$4b$$ greater than $$a^2$$,
the two values of $$x$$ are always imaginary, since it would be
required to extract the square root of a negative quantity;
on the contrary, if $$b$$ be less than $$\frac{1}{4}a^2$$, or even less than 0,
that is to say, if it be a negative number, both values will
be possible or real. But, whether they be real or imaginary,
it is no less true, that they are still expressible, and always
have this property, that their sum is equal to $$a$$, and their
product equal to $$b$$. Thus, in the equation $$x^2 -6x+ 10=0$$,
the sum of the two values of $$x$$ must be 6, and the product
of these two values must be 10; now, we find,

$$\textrm{I)} \; x= 3 + \surd -1,$$

and

$$\textrm{II)} \; x=3-\surd -1,$$

quantities whose sum is 6, and the product 10. 

<span class="art">702</span> The expression which we have just found may likewise be represented in a manner
more general, and so as
to be applied to equations of this form, $$fx^2 \pm gx + h=0$$;
for this equation gives

$$x^2=\mp \dfrac{gx}{f} - \dfrac{h}{f},$$

and

$$x= \mp \dfrac{g}{2f} \pm \surd \left(\frac{g^2}{4f^2}-\frac{h}{f}\right),$$

or

$$x = \dfrac{\mp g \pm \surd(g^2-4fh)}{2f};$$

whence we conclude, that the two
values are imaginary, and consequently, the equation impossible, when $$4fh$$ is
greater than $$g^2$$; that is to say, when,
in the equation $$fx^2 - gx + h=0$$,
four times the product of
the first and the last term exceeds the square of the second
term: for the product of the first and the last term, taken
four times, is $$4fhx^2$$, and the square of the middle term is
$$g^2x^2$$; now, if $$4fhx^2$$ be greater than $$g^2x^2$$, $$4fh$$ is also greater
than $$g^2$$, and, in that case, the equation is evidently impossible; but
in all other cases, the equation is possible,
and two real values of $$x$$ may be assigned. It is true, they
are often irrational; but we have already seen, that, in
such cases, we may always find them by approximation:
whereas no approximations can take place with regard to
imaginary expressions, such as $$\surd -5$$; for 100 is as far
from being the value of that root, as 1, or any other number.

<span class="art">703</span> We have farther to observe, that any quantity of
the second degree, $$x^2 \pm ax \pm b$$, must always be resolvible
into two factors, such as

$$(x \pm p) (x \pm q).$$

For, if we
took three factors, such as these, we should come to a
quantity of the third degree; and taking only one such
factor, we should not exceed the first degree. It is therefore certain, that every equation
of the second degree
necessarily contains two values of $$x$$, and that it can neither
have more nor less

<span class="art">704</span> We have already seen, that when the two factors
are found, the two values of $$x$$ are also known, since each
factor gives one of those values, by making it equal to 0.
The converse also is true, viz. that when we have found
one value of $$x$$, we know also one of the factors of the
equation; for if $$x=p$$ represents one of the values of $$x$$,
in any equation of the second degree, $$x-p$$ is one of the
factors of that equation; that is to say, all the terms having
heen brought to one side, the equation is divisible by
$$x - p$$; and farther, the quotient expresses the other factor. 

<span class="art">705</span> In order to illustrate what we have now said, let
there be given the equation $$x^2+4x-21=0$$, in which
we know that $$x=3$$ is one of the values of $$x$$, because
$$(3 \cdot 3)+(4 \cdot 3)-21=0$$; this shows, that $$x-3$$ is one of
the factors of the equation, or that $$x^2+4x-21$$ is divisible
by $$x-3$$, which the actual division proves. Thus,

</a>

So that the other factor is $$x + 7$$, and our equation is represented by the
product $$(x-3) (x+7)=0$$; whence two values of $$x$$ immediately follow, the
first factor giving $$x=3$$, and the other $$x= -7$$.
