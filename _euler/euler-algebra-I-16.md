### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 16. "Of Powers in general."

> **168.** The product which we obtain by multiplying a number once, or several times by itself, is
called a *power*. Thus, a square which arises from the multiplication of a number by itself,
> and a cube which we obtain by multiplying a number twice by itself, are powers. We say also in
> the former case, that the number is raised to the second degree, or to the second power;
> and in the latter, that the number is raised to the third degree, or to the third power.
>
> **169.** We distinguish those powers from one another by the number of times that the given
> number has been multiplied by itself. For example, a square is called the second
> power, because a certain given number has been multiplied by itself; and if a number has
> been multiplied twice by itself we call the product the third power, which
> therefore means the same as the cube; also if we multiply a number three times by itself we
> obtain its fourth power, or what is commonly called the *biquadrate*: and thus it will be easy
> to understand what is meant by the fifth, sixth, seventh, etc. power of a number.
> I shall only add, that powers, after the fourth degree, cease to have any other but
> these numeral distinctions.
>
> **170.** To illustrate this still better, we may observe, in the first place,
> that the powers of 1 remain always the same; because,
> whatever number of times we multiply 1 by itself, the product is found to be always 1.
> We shall therefore begin by representing the powers of 2 and of 3, which succeed
> each other as in the following order:

> But the powers of the number 10 are the most remarkable: for on these powers the system of
