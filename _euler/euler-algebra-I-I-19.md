<span class="art">195</span> We have shown in the preceding chapter, that the
square of any power is found by doubling the exponent of
that power; or that, in general, the square, or the second
power, of $$a^n$$, is $$a^{2n}$$; and the converse also follows,
namely that
the square root of the power $$a^{2n}$$ is $$a^n$$, which is found by
taking half the exponent of that power, or dividing it
by 2.

<span class="art">196</span> Thus, the square root of $$a^2$$ is $$a^1$$, or $$a$$;
that of $$a^4$$ is $$a^2$$; that of $$a^6$$ is $$a^3$$; and so on:
and, as this is general,
the square root of $$a^3$$ must necessarily be $$a^{\frac{3}{2}}$$
and that of $$a^5$$ must be $$a^{\frac{5}{2}}$$;
consequently, we shall in the same manner
have $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ for the square root of $$a$$.
Whence we see that $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
is equal to $$\surd a$$; which new method of representing the
square root demands particular attention.

<span class="art">197</span> We have also shown, that, to find the cube of a
power, as $$a^n$$, we must multiply its exponent by 3,
and consequently that cube is $$a^{3n}$$.

Hence, conversely, when it is required to find the third,
or cube root, of the power $$a^{3n}$$, we have only to divide that
exponent by 3, and may therefore with certainty conclude,
that the root required is $$a^n$$: consequently $$a^1$$ or $$a$$,
is the cube root of $$a^3$$; $$a^2$$ is the cube root of $$a^6$$;
$$a^3$$ of $$a^9$$; and so on.

<span class="art">198</span> There is nothing to prevent us from applying the
same reasoning to those cases, in which the exponent is not
divisible by 3, or from concluding that the cube root of $$a^2$$
is $$a^{\frac{2}{3}}$$, and that the cube root of $$a^4$$ is $$a^{\frac{4}{3}}$$,
or $$a^{1\frac{1}{3}}$$; consequently, the third, or cube root of $$a$$, or $$a^1$$,
must be $$a^{\frac{1}{3}}$$:
whence also, it appears, that $$a^{\frac{1}{3}}$$ is the same as $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a$$.

<span class="art">199</span> It is the same with roots of a higher degree: thus,
the fourth root of $$a$$ will be $$a^{\frac{1}{4}}$$, which expression has the
same value as $$\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}}a$$; the fifth root of $$a$$ will be $$a^{\frac{1}{5}}$$,
which is
consequently equivalent to $$\sqrt[5]{\vphantom{1}}a$$; and the same observation
may be extended to all roots of a higher degree.

<span class="art">200</span> We may therefore entirely reject the radical signs at
present made use of, and employ in their stead the fractional
exponents which we have just explained: but as we have
been long accustomed to those signs, and meet with them in
most books of Algebra, it might be wrong to banish them
entirely from calculation; there is, however, sufficient reason
also to employ, as is now frequently done, the other method
of notation, because it manifestly corresponds with the nature
of the thing. In fact, we see immediately that $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ is the
square root of $$a$$, because we know that the square of $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$,
that is to say, $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ multiplied by $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$,
is equal to $$a^1$$, or $$a$$.

<span class="art">201</span> What has been now said is sufficient to show how
we are to understand all other fractional exponents that may
occur. If we have, for example, $$a^{\frac{4}{3}}$$, this means, that we
must first take the fourth power of $$a$$, and then extract its
cube, or third root; so that $$a^{\frac{4}{3}}$$ is the same as the common
expression $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a^4$$ Hence, to find the value of $$a^{\frac{3}{4}}$$,
we must
first take the cube, or the third power of $$a$$, which is $$a^3$$, and
then extract the fourth root of that power; so that $$a^{\frac{3}{4}}$$ is the
same as $$\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}}a^3$$, and $$a^{\frac{4}{5}}$$ is equal to
$$\sqrt[5]{\vphantom{1}}a^4$$, etc.

<span class="art">202</span> When the fraction which represents the exponent
exceeds unity, we may express the value of the given quantity in another way:
for instance, suppose it to be $$a^{\frac{5}{2}}$$; this
quantity is equivalent to $$a^{2\frac{1}{2}}$$,
which is the product of $$a^2$$ by
$$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$: now $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ being equal to $$\surd a$$,
it is evident that $$a^{\frac{5}{2}}$$ is
equal to $$a^2 \surd a^5$$; also $$a^{\frac{10}{3}}$$, or $$a^{3\frac{1}{3}}$$,
is equal to $$a^3 \sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a$$; and
$$a^{\frac{15}{4}}$$, that is, $$a^{3\frac{3}{4}}$$, expresses
$$a^3 \sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}} a^3$$. These examples are sufficient to illustrate the
great utility of fractional exponents.

<span class="art">203</span> Their use extends also to fractional numbers: for if
there be given $$\frac{1}{\surd a}$$, we know that this quantity is equal to
$$\frac{1}{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$; and we have seen already that a fraction of the form
$$\frac{1}{a^n}$$ may be expressed by $$a^{-n}$$; so that instead of $$\frac{1}{\surd a}$$
we may use the expresssion $$a^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$; and, in the same manner,
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}} a}$$
is equal to $$a^{-\frac{1}{3}}$$. Again, if the quantity
$$\frac{a^2}{\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}} a^3}$$
be
proposed; let it be transformed into this, $$\frac{a^2}{a^{\frac{3}{4}}}$$,
which is the
product of $$a^2$$ by $$a^{-\frac{3}{4}}$$; now this product is equivalent to
$$a^{\frac{5}{4}}$$, or to $$a^{1\frac{1}{4}}$$, or lastly, to $$a\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}}a$$.
Practice will render similar
reductions easy.

<span class="art">204</span> We shall observe, in the last place, that each root
may be represented in a variety of ways; for $$\surd a$$ being the
same as $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$, and ½ being transformable into the fractions, ²⁄₄,
³⁄₆, ⁴⁄₈, ⁵⁄₁₀, ⁶⁄₁₂, etc.
it is evident that $$\surd a$$ is equal to $$\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}}a^2$$ or to
$$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a^3$$, or to $$\sqrt[8]{\vphantom{1}}a^4$$, and so on.
In the same manner, $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a$$, which
is equal to $$a^{\frac{1}{3}}$$, will be equal to $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a^2$$,
or to $$\sqrt[9]{\vphantom{1}}a^3$$, or to $$\sqrt[12]{\vphantom{1}}a^4$$.
Hence also we see that the number $$a$$, or $$a^1$$, might be represented
by the following radical expressions:

$$\sqrt[2]{\vphantom{1}}a^2, \; \sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a^3, \; \sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}}a^4, \; \sqrt[5]{\vphantom{1}}a^5, \; \textrm{etc.}$$

<span class="art">205</span> This property is of great use in multiplication and
division; for if we have, for example, to multiply $$\sqrt[2]{\vphantom{1}}a$$ by $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a$$,
we write $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a^3$$ for $$\sqrt[2]{\vphantom{1}}a$$
and $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a^2$$ instead of $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a$$;
so that in this manner we obtain the same radical sign for both, and the
multiplication being now performed, gives the product $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a^5$$.
The same result is also deduced from $$a^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}}$$, which is the
product of $$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ multiplied by $$a^{\frac{1}{3}}$$;
for $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{6}$$, and consequently the product required is $$a^{\frac{5}{6}}$$,
or $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a^5$$.

On the contrary, if it were required to divide $$\sqrt[2]{\vphantom{1}}a$$, or
$$a^{\frac{1}{2}}$$, 
by $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}}a$$, or $$a^{\frac{1}{3}}$$, we should have for the quotient $$a^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}}$$,
or $$a^{\frac{3}{6}-\frac{2}{6}}$$, that is to say, $$a^{\frac{1}{6}}$$, or $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}}a$$.
