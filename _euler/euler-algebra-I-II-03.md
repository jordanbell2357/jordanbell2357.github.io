<span class="art">270</span> When it is only required to represent multiplication, we put each of the
expressions, that are to be multiplied together, within two parentheses, and join them to each other, sometimes without any sign, and sometimes placing a point ⋅ between them.

Thus, for example, to represent the product of the two expressions $$a-b+c$$
and $$d-e+f$$ we write

$$(a-b+c) \cdot (d-e+f)$$

or barely,

$$(a - b + c) (d-e+f)$$

which method of expressing products is much used, because it immediately exhibits
the factors of which they are composed.

<span class="art">271</span> But in order to show how multiplication is actually performed, we may remark,
in the first place, that to multiply, for example, a quantity, such
as $$a-b+c$$, by 2, each term of it is separately multiplied by that number;
so that the product is

$$2a-2b+2c.$$

And the same thing takes place with regard to all other
numbers; for if $$d$$ were the number by which it was required
to multiply the same expression, we should obtain

$$ad-bd+cd.$$

<span class="art">272</span> In the last article, we have supposed $$d$$ to be a
positive number; but if the multiplier were a negative number,
as $$-e$$, the rule formerly given must be applied; namely,
that unlike signs multiplied together produce -, and like
signs +. Thus we should have

$$-ae+be-ce.$$

<span class="art">273</span> Now, in order to show how a quantity, $$A$$, is to be
multiplied by a compound quantity, $$d-e$$; let us first consider an example in numbers, supposing that $$A$$ is to be multiplied by 7-3. Here it is evident, that we are required
to take the quadruple of $$A$$: for if we first take $$A$$ seven
times, it will then be necessary to subtract $$3A$$ from that
product.

In general, therefore, if it be required to multiply $$A$$
by $$d-e$$, we multiply the quantity $$A$$ first by $$d$$,
and then by $$e$$, and subtract this last product from the
first: whence results $$dA-eA$$.

If we now suppose that $$A=a-b$$, and that this is the quantity
to be multiplied by $$d-e$$; we shall have

$$
\begin{gather}
dA=ad-bd\\
eA=ae-be
\end{gather}
$$

whence $$dA-cA=ad-bd-ae+be$$ is the product required.

<span class="art">274</span> Since therefore we know accurately the product
$$(a-b)\cdot (d-e)$$, we shall now exhibit the same example
of multiplication under the following form:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
a&-b&&\\
d&-e&&\\
\hline
ad&-bd&-ae&+be.
\end{array}
$$

Which shows, that we must multiply each term of the upper
expression by each term of the lower, and that, with regard
to the signs, we must strictly observe the rule before given;
a rule which this circumstance would completely confirm, if
it admitted of the least doubt.

<span class="art">275</span> It will be easy, therefore, according to this method,
to calculate the following example, which is, to multiply
$$a+b$$ by $$a-b$$;

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
a&+b&\\
a&-b&\\
\hline
a^2&+ab&\\
&-ab&-b^2\\
\hline
\textrm{Product}&a^2&-b^2.
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">276</span> Now, we may substitute for $$a$$ and $$b$$ any numbers
whatever; so that the above example will furnish the following theorem; namely,
The sum of two numbers, multiplied
by their difference, is equal to the difference of the squares
of those numbers: which theorem may be expressed thus:

$$(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2.$$

And from this another theorem may be derived; namely,
The difference of two square numbers is always a product,
and divisible both by the sum and by the difference of the
roots of those two squares; consequently, the difference of
two squares can never be a prime number.

<span class="art">277</span> Let us now calculate some other examples:

I)

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
2a&-3&\\
a&+2&\\
\hline
2a^2&-3a&\\
&4a&-6\\
\hline
2a^2&+a&+6
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
4a^2&-6a&+9&\\
2a&+3&&\\
\hline
8a^3&-12a^2&+18a&\\
&+12a^2&-18a&+27\\
\hline
8a^3&+27&&
\end{array}
$$

---

III)

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
3a^2&-2ab&-b^2&\\
2a&-4b&&\\
\hline
6a^3&-4a^2b&-2ab^2&\\
&-12a^2b&+8ab^2&+4b^3\\
\hline
6a^3&-16a^2b&+6ab^2&+4b^3
\end{array}
$$

---

IV)

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
a^2&+2ab&+2b^2&&\\
a^2&-2ab&+2b^2&&\\
\hline
a^4&+2a^3b&+2a^2b^2&&\\
&-2a^3b&-4a^2b^2&-4ab^3&\\
&&+2a^2b^2&+4ab^3&+4b^4\\
\hline
a^4&+4b^4&&
\end{array}
$$

---

V)

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
2a^2&-3ab&-4b^2&&\\
3a^2&-2ab&+b^2&&\\
\hline
6a^4&-9a^3b&-12a^2b^2&&\\
&-4a^3b&+6a^2b^2&+8ab^3&\\
&&+2a^2b^2&-3ab^3&-4b^4\\
\hline
6a^4&-13a^3b&-4a^2b^2&+5ab^3&-4b^4\\
\end{array}
$$

---

VI)

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrr}
a^2&+b^2&+c^2&-ab&-ac&-bc&&&&\\
a&+b&+c&&&&&&&\\
\hline
a^3&+ab^2&+ac^2&-a^2b&-abc&-a^2c&-abc&&&\\
&-ab^2&&+a^2b&&-abc&+b^3&+bc^2&-b^2c&\\
&&-ac^2&&+a^2c&-abc&&-bc^2&+b^2c&+c^3\\
\hline
a^3&-3abc&+b^3&+c^3&&&&&&
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">278</span> When we have more than two quantities to multiply together, it will easily
be understood that, after having multiplied two of them together, we must then
multiply that product by one of those which remain, and so on:
but it is indifferent what order is observed in those multiplications.

Let it be proposed, for example, to find the value, or
product, of the four following factors, namely

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>I.</th>
    <th>II.</th>
    <th>III.</th>
    <th>IV.</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>\((a+b)\)</td>
    <td>\((a^2+ab+b^2)\)</td>
    <td>\((c-d)\)</td>
    <td>\((a^2-ab+b^2)\)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

First, multiply factors I. and II.:

$$
\begin{array}{lrrrr}
\textrm{II.}&a^2&+ab&+b^2&\\
\textrm{I.}&a&+b&&\\
\hline
&a^3&+a^2&+ab^2&\\
&+a^2b&+ab^2&+b^3\\
\hline
\textrm{I. II.}&a^3&+2a^2b&+2ab^2&+b^3
\end{array}
$$

Then multiply factors III. and IV.:

$$
\begin{array}{lrrrr}
\textrm{IV.}&a^2&-ab&+b^2&\\
\textrm{III.}&a&-b&&\\
\hline
&a^3&-a^2&+ab^2&\\
&-a^2b&+ab^2&-b^3\\
\hline
\textrm{III. IV.}&a^3&-2a^2b&+2ab^2&-b^3
\end{array}
$$

It remains now to multiply the first product I. II. by this
second product III. IV.

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
a^3&+2a^2b&+2ab^2&+b^3&&&\\
a^3&-2a^2b&+2ab^2&-b^3&&&\\
\hline
a^6&+2a^5b&+2a^4b^2&+a^3b^3&&&\\
&-2a^5b&-4a^4b^2&-4a^3b^3&-2a^2b^4&&\\
&&2a^4b^2&+4a^3b^3&+4a^2b^4&2ab^5&\\
&&&-a^3b^3&-2a^2b^4&-2ab^5&-b^6\\
\hline
a^6&-b^6&&&&&
\end{array}
$$

which is the product required.

<span class="art">279</span> Now let us resume the same example, but change
the order of it, first multiplying the factors I. and III. and
then II. and IV. together:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
\textrm{I. II.}&a^3&+2a^2b&+2ab^2&+b^3&&&\\
\textrm{III. IV.}&a^3&-2a^2b&+2ab^2&-b^3&&&\\
\hline
&a^6&+2a^5b&+2a^4b^2&+a^3b^3&&&\\
&-2a^5b&-4a^4b^2&-4a^3b^3&-2a^2b^4&&\\
&&+2a^4b^2&+4a^3b^3&+4a^2b^4&+2ab^5&\\
&&&-a^3b^3&-2a^2b^4&-2ab^5&-b^6\\
\hline
&a^6&-b^6&&&&
\end{array}
$$

which is the product required.

<span class="art">280</span> We may perform this calculation in a manner still
more concise, by first multiplying the factor I. by factor IV.
and then factor II. by factor III.

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
\textrm{I.}&a&+b&\\
\textrm{III.}&a&-b&\\
\hline
&a^2&+ab&\\
&&-ab&-ab^2\\
\hline
\textrm{I. III.}&a^2&-b^2&
\end{array}
$$

---

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
\textrm{II.}&a^2&+ab&b^2&&\\
\textrm{IV.}&a^2&-ab&+b^2&&\\
\hline
&a^4&+a^3b&+a^2b^2&&\\
&&-a^3b&-a^2b^2&-ab^3&\\
&&&+a^2b^2&+ab^3&+b^4\\
\hline
\textrm{II. IV.}&a^4&+a^2b^2&+b^4&&\\
\end{array}
$$

It remains to multiply the product I. IV. by that of II. and III.

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
\textrm{I. IV.}&a^3&+b^3&\\
\textrm{II. III.}&a^3&-b^3&\\
\hline
&a^6&+a^3b^3&\\
&&-a^3b^3&-b^6\\
\hline
&a^6&-b^6&
\end{array}
$$

the same result as before.

<span class="art">281</span> It will be proper to illustrate this example by a
numerical application. For this purpose, let us make $$a=3$$
and $$b=2$$, we shall then have $$a+b=5$$, and $$a-b=1$$;
farther, $$a^2=9$$, $$ab=6$$, and $$b^2=4$$: therefore
$$a^2+ab+b^2=19$$, and $$a^2-ab+b^2=7$$: so that the
product required is that of

5 ⋅ 19 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 7, which is 665.

Now, $$a^6=729$$, and $$b^6=64$$; consequently, the product
required is $$a^6-b^6=665$$, as we have already seen.
