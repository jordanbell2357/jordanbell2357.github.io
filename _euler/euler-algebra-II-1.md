### Part {{ page.part}}. {{ page.title }}

<span class="art">1</span> It has been shown, in the First Part, how one unknown
quantity is determined by a single equation, and how we
may determine two unknown quantities by means of two
equations, three unknown quantities by three equations, and
so on; so that there must always be as many equations as
there are unknown quantities to determine, at least when the
question itself is determinate.

When a question, therefore, does not furnish as many
equations as there are unknown quantities to be determined,
some of these must remain undetermined, and depend on
our will; for which reason, such questions are said to be
**indeterminate**; forming the subject of a particular branch of
algebra, which is called **Indeterminate Analysis**.

<span class="art">2</span> As in those cases we may assume any numbers for one,
or more unknown quantities, they also admit of several
solutions: but, on the other hand, as there is usually annexed the condition,
that the numbers sought are to be integer and positive, or at least rational,
the number of all the possible solutions of those questions is greatly limited: so
that often there are very few of them possible; at other
times, there may be an infinite number, but such as are not
readily obtained; and sometimes, also, none of them are
possible. Hence it happens, that this part of analysis frequently
requires artifices entirely appropriate to it, which are
of great service in exercising the judgment of beginners, and
giving them dexterity in calculation.

<span class="art">3</span> To begin with one of the easiest questions. Let it be
required to find two positive, integer numbers, the sum of
which shall be equal to 10.

Let us represent those members by $$x$$ and $$y$$; then we have
$$x+y = 10$$; and $$x = 10 - y$$, where $$y$$ is so far only determined,
that this letter must represent an integer and positive
number. We may therefore substitute for it all integer
numbers from 1 to infinity: but since $$x$$ must likewise be a
positive number, it follows, that it cannot be taken greater
than 10, for otherwise $$x$$ would become negative; and if
we also reject the value of $$x=0$$, we cannot make $$y$$ greater
than 9; so that only the following solutions can take
place

<table>
<tr>
<td>If \(y=\)</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>then \(x=\)</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>

But, the last four of these nine solutions being the same as
the first four, it is evident, that the question really admits
only of five different solutions.

If three numbers were required, the sum of which might
make 10, we should have only to divide one of the numbers
already found into two parts, by which means we should
obtain a greater number of solutions.

<span class="art">4</span> As we have found no difficulty in this question, we
will proceed to others, which require different considerations.

*Question 1.* Let it be required to divide 25 into two parts,
the one of which may be divisible by 2, and the other by 3.

Let one of the parts sought be $$2x$$, and the other $$3y$$; we shall
then have $$2x+3y=25$$; consequently $$2x=25-3y$$; and dividing by 2,
we obtain $$x=\dfrac{25-3y}{2}$$; whence we conclude, in the first place,
that $$3y$$ must be less than 25, and, consequently, $$y$$ is less than 8.
Also, if, from this value of $$x$$, we take out as many integers as we possibly
can, that is to say, if we divide by the denominator 2, we shall have
$$x=12-y+\dfrac{1-y}{2}$$; whence it follows, that $$1-y$$, or rather $$y-1$$,
must be divisible by 2. Let us, therefore, make $$y-1=2z$$; and we shall
have $$y=2z+1$$, so that

$$x=12-2z-1-z=11-3z.$$

And, since $$y$$ cannot be greater than 8, we must not substitute any numbers
for $$z$$ which would render $$2z+1$$ greater
than 8; conseuently, $$z$$ must be less than 4, that is to say,
$$z$$ cannot be taken greater than 3, for which reasons we have
the following answers:

<table>
<tr>
<td>If we make</td>
<td>\(z=0\)</td>
<td>\(z=1\)</td>
<td>\(z=2\)</td>
<td>\(z=3\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>we have</td>
<td>\(y=1\)</td>
<td>\(y=3\)</td>
<td>\(y=7\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>and</td>
<td>\(x=11\)</td>
<td>\(x=8\)</td>
<td>\(x=5\)</td>
<td>\(x=2\)</td>
</tr>
</table>

Hence, the two parts of 25 sought, are

22 + 3; 16 + 9; 10 + 15; or 4 + 21.

<span class="art">5</span> *Question 2.* To divide 100 into two such parts, that
the one may be divisible by 7, and the other by 11.

Let $$7x$$ be the first part, and $$11y$$ the second.
Then we must have $$7x+11y=100$$; and, consequently,

$$
\begin{gather}
x=\dfrac{100-11y}{7}=\dfrac{98+2-7y-4y}{7}\\
x=14-y+\dfrac{2-4y}{7};
\end{gather}
$$

wherefore $$2-4y$$, or $$4y-2$$, must be divisible by 7.

Now, if we can divide $$4y-2$$ by 7, we may also divide
its half, $$2y-1$$, by 7. Let us therefore make $$2y-1=7z$$,
or $$2y=7z+1$$, and we shall have $$x=14-y-2z$$;
but, since $$2y=7z+1=6z+z+1$$, we shall have $$y=3z+\dfrac{z+1}{2}$$.
Let us therefore make $$z+1=2u$$, or $$z=2u-1$$; which supposition
gives $$y=3z+u$$; and, consequently, we may substitute for $$u$$ every
integer number that does not make $$x$$ or $$y$$ negative. Now, as
$$y$$ becomes $$=7u-3$$, and $$x=19-11u$$, the first of these
expressions shows that $$7u$$ must exceed 3; and according to the second,
$$11u$$ must be less than 19, or $$u$$ less than ¹⁹⁄₁₁:
so that $$u$$ cannot be 2; and since it is impossible for this number to be
0, we must have $$u=1$$: which is the only value that this letter can have.
Hence, we obtain $$x=8$$, and $$y=4$$; and the two parts of 100 which were
required, are 56 and 44.

<span class="art">6</span> *Question 3.* To divide 100 into two such parts, that
dividing the first by 5, there may remain 2; and dividing
the second by 7, the remainder may be 4.

Since the first part, divided by 5, leaves the remainder
2, let us suppose it to be $$5x+2$$; and, for a similar reason,
we may represent the second part by $$7y + 4$$: we shall thus
have $$5x+7y+6=100$$, or

$$5x=94-7y=90+4-5y-2y;$$

whence we obtain $$x=18-y+\dfrac{4-2y}{5}$$. Hence it follows,
that $$4-2y$$, or $$2y-4$$, or the half $$y-2$$, must be divisible
by 5. For this reason, let us make $$y-2=5z$$, or
$$y=5z+2$$, and we shall have $$x=16-7z$$; whence we conclude,
that $$7z$$ must be less than 16, and $$z$$ less than ¹⁶⁄₇,
that is to say, $$z$$ cannot exceed 2. The question proposed,
therefore, admits of three answers:

1. $$z=0$$ gives $$x=16$$, and $$y=2$$; whence the two parts are 82 + 18.
2. $$z=1$$ gives $$x=9$$, and $$y=7$$; and the two parts are 47 + 53.
3. $$z=2$$ gives $$x=2$$, and $$y=12$$; and the two parts are 12 + 88.

<span class="art">7</span> *Question 4.* Two women have together 100 eggs: one
says to the other; "When I count my eggs by eights,
there is an overplus of 7." The second replies:
"If I count mine by tens, I find the same overplus of 7." How many
eggs had each?

As the number of eggs belonging to the first woman,
divided by 8, leaves the remainder 7; and the number of
eggs belonging to the second, divided by 10, gives the same
remainder 7; we may express the first number by
$$8x+7$$, and the second by $$10y+7$$; so that $$8x+10y+14=100$$,
or $$8x=86-10y$$, or

$$4x=43-5y=40+3-4y-y.$$

Consequently, if we make $$y-3=4z$$, so that $$y=4z+3$$,
we shall have

$$x=10-4z-3-z=7-5z;$$

whence it follows, that $$5z$$ must be less than 7, or $$z$$ less
than 2; that is to say, we shall only have the two following answers:

1. $$z=0$$ gives $$x=7$$, and $$y=3$$; so that the first woman has 63 eggs, and the second 37.
2. $$z=1$$ gives $$x=2$$, and $$y=7$$; therefore the first woman 23 eggs, and the second had 77.
