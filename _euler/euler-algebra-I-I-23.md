<span class="art">242</span> We have seen that the logarithm of 2 is greater than ³⁄₁₀,
and less than ⅓, and that, consequently, the exponent
of 10 must fall between those two fractions, in order that the
power may become 2. Now, although we know this, yet
whatever fraction we assume on this condition, the power
resulting from it will always be an irrational number,
greater or less than 2; and, consequently, the logarithm of 2 cannot
be accurately expressed by such a fraction: therefore we
must content ourselves with determining the value of that
logarithm by such an approximation as may render the
error of little or no importance; for which purpose, we
employ what are called **decimal fractions**, the nature and
properties of which ought to be explained as clearly as
possible.

<span class="art">243</span> It is well known that, in the ordinary way of writing
numbers by means of the ten figures, or characters,

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

the first figure on the right alone has its natural signification
;
that the figures in the second place have ten times the value
which they would have had in the first; that the figures in
the third place have a hundred times the value; and those
in the fourth a thousand times, and so on: so that as they
advance towards the left, they acquire a value ten times
greater than they had in the preceding rank. Thus, in the
number 1765, the figure 5 is in the first place on the right,
and is just equal to 5; in the second place is 6; but this
figure, instead of 6, represents 10 · 6, or 60: the figure 7
is in the third place, and represents 100 · 7, or 700; and
lastly, the 1, which is in the fourth row, becomes 1000; so
that we read the given number thus;

> One thousand, seven hundred, and sixty-five.

<span class="art">244</span> As the value of figures becomes always ten times
greater, as we go from the right towards the left, and as it
consequently becomes continually ten times less as we go
from the left towards the right; we may, in conformity with
this law, advance still farther towards the right, and obtain
figures whose value will continue to become ten times less
than in the preceding place: but it must be observed, that
the place where the figures have their natural value is
marked by a point. So that if we meet, for example, with
the number 36 · 54892, it is to be understood in this manner:
the figure 6, in the first place, has its natural value; and the
figure 3, which is in the second place to the left, means 30.
But the figure 5, which comes after the point, expresses
only ⁵⁄₁₀; and the 4 is equal only to ⁴⁄₁₀₀; the figure 8 is
equal to ⁸⁄₁₀₀₀; the figure 9 is equal to ⁹⁄₁₀₀₀₀; and the
figure 2 is equal to ²⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀. We see then, that the more
those figures advance towards the right, the more their
values diminish, and at last, those values become so small,
that they may be considered as nothing.

<span class="art">245</span> This is the kind of numbers which we call
**decimal fractions**, and in this manner logarithms are represented in
the Tables. The logarithm of 2, for example, is expressed
by 0.3010300; in which we see, first, That since there is 0
before the point, this logarithm does not contain an integer;
second, that its value is

³⁄₁₀ + ⁰⁄₁₀₀ + ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ + ⁰⁄₁₀₀₀₀ + ³⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀ + ⁰⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀ + ⁰⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀.

We might have left out the two
last ciphers, but they serve to show that the logarithm in
question contains none of those parts, which have 1000000
and 10000000 for the denominator. It is however to be
understood, that, by continuing the series, we might have
found still smaller parts; but with regard to these, they are
neglected, on account of their extreme minuteness.

<span class="art">246</span> The logarithm of 3 is expressed in the Table by
0.4771213; we see, therefore, that it contains no integer,
and that it is composed of the following fractions:

⁴⁄₁₀ + ⁷⁄₁₀₀ + ⁷⁄₁₀₀₀ + ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀ + ²⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀ + ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀ + ³⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀.

But we must not suppose that the logarithm is thus expressed
with the utmost exactness; we are only certain that the error
is less than ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀; which is certainly so small, that it
may very well be neglected in most calculations.

<span class="art">247</span> According to this method of expressing logarithms,
that of 1 must be represented by 0.0000000, since it is
really = 0: the logarithm of 10 is 1.0000
000, where it evidently
is exactly = 1: the logarithm of 100 is 2.0000000,
or 2. And hence we may conclude, that the logarithms of
all numbers, which are included between 10 and 100, and
consequently composed of two figures, are comprehended
between 1 and 2, and therefore must be expressed by 1 plus
a decimal fraction, as $$\log 50=1.6989700$$; its value
therefore is unity, plus

⁶⁄₁₀ + ⁹⁄₁₀₀ + ⁸⁄₁₀₀₀ + ⁹⁄₁₀₀₀₀ + ⁷⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀:

and it will be also easily perceived, that the logarithms of
numbers, between 100 and 1000, are expressed by the integer
2 with a decimal fraction: those of numbers between 1000
and 10000, by 3 plus a decimal fraction: those of numbers
between 10000 and 100000, by 4 integers plus a decimal
fraction, and so on. Thus, $$\log 800$$, for example, is
2.9030900; that of 2290 is 3.3598355, etc.

<span class="art">248</span> On the other hand, the logarithms of numbers which
are less than 10, or expressed by a single figure, do not contain an integer,
and for this reason we find before the
point: so that we have two parts to consider in a logarithm.
First, that which precedes the point, or the integral part;
and the other, the decimal fractions that are to be added to
the former. The first part of a logarithm, which is
usually called the **integral part**, is easily determined from
what we have said in the preceding article. Thus, it is
0, for all the numbers which have but one figure; it is 1,
for those which have two; it is 2, for those which have
three; and, in general, it is always one less than the number
of figures. If therefore the logarithm of 1766 be required,
we already know that the first part, or that of the integers,
is necessarily 3.

<span class="art">249</span> So reciprocally, we know at the first sight of the
integral part of a logarithm, how many figures compose the
number answering to that logarithm; since the number of
those figures always exceed the integral part of the logarithm
by unity. Suppose, for example, the number answering to
the logarithm 6.4771213 were required, we know immediately
that that number must have seven figures, and be
greater than 1000000. And in fact this number is 3000000;
for $$\log 3000000 = \log 3 + \log 1000000$$. Now
$$\log 3 = 0.4771213$$, and $$\log 1000000 = 6$$, and the sum of those two
logarithms is 6.4771213.

<span class="art">250</span> The principal consideration therefore with respect
to each logarithm is, the decimal fraction which follows the
point, and even that, when once known, serves for several
numbers. In order to prove this, let us consider the logarithm of the number 365;
its first part is undoubtedly 2;
with respect to the other, or the decimal fraction, let us at
present represent it by the letter $$x$$; we shall have
$$\log 365 = 2 + x$$; then multiplying continually by 10, we shall
have $$\log 3650 = 3 + x$$; $$\log 36500 = 4 + x$$; $$\log 365000 = 5 + x$$, and so on.

But we can also go back, and continually divide by 10;
which will give us $$\log 36.5 = 1+x$$; $$\log 3.65 = 0+x$$;
$$\log 0.365 = -1+x$$; $$\log 0.0365 = -2+x$$;
$$\log 0.00365 = -3+x$$, and so on.

<span class="art">251</span> All those numbers then which arise from the figures
365, whether preceded, or followed, by ciphers, have always
the same decimal fraction for the second part of the logarithm:
and the whole difference lies in the integer before
the point, which, as we have seen, may become negative;
namely, when the number proposed is less than 1. Now, as
ordinary calculators find a difficulty in managing negative
numbers, it is usual, in those cases, to increase the integers
of the logarithm by 10, that is, to write 10 instead of 0
before the point; so that instead of -1 we have 9; instead
of -2 we have 8; instead of -3 we have 7, etc.; but then
we must remember, that the integral part has been taken
ten units too great, and by no means suppose that the number consists of
10, 9, or 8 figures. It is likewise easy to
conceive, that, if in the case we speak of, this integral part be
less than 10, we must write the figures of the number after
a point, to show that they are decimals: for example, if the
integral part be 9, we must begin at the first place after a
point; if it be 8, we must also place a cipher in the first
row, and not begin to write the figures till the second: thus
9.5622929 would be the logarithm of 0.365, and 8.5622929
the log of 0.0365. But this manner of writing logarithms
is principally employed in Tables of sines.

<span class="art">252</span> In the common Tables, the decimals of logarithms
are usually carried to seven places of figures, the last of
which consequently represents the ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀ part, and we
are sure that they are never erroneous by the whole of this
part, and that therefore the error cannot be of any importance.
There are, however, calculations in which we require
still greater exactness; and then we employ the large Tables
of *Vlacq*, where the logarithms are calculated to ten decimal
places.[^1] [^2]

<span class="art">253</span> As the first part, or integral part, of a logarithm, is
subject to no difficulty, it is seldom expressed in the Tables;
the second part only is written, or the seven figures of the
decimal fraction. There is a set of English Tables in which
we find the logarithms of all numbers from 1 to 100000,
and even those of greater numbers; for small additional
Tables show what is to be added to the logarithms, in proportion to the figures,
which the proposed numbers have
more than those in the Tables. We easily find, for example,
the logarithm of 379456, by means of that of 37945
and the small Tables of which we speak.

<span class="art">254</span> From what has been said, it will easily be perceived,
how we are to obtain from the Tables the number corresponding to any logarithm which may occur.
Thus, in multiplying the numbers 343 and 2401; since we must add
together the logarithms of those numbers, the calculation
we be as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
\log 343&=&=2.5352941\\
\log 2401&=&3.3803922\\ \hline
\textrm{their sum}&=&5.9156863\\
\textrm{nearest tabular log} \qquad \log 823540&=&5.9156847\\ \hline
\textrm{difference}&=&0.0000016
\end{array}
$$

which in the Table of Differences answers to 3;
this therefore being used instead of the cipher, gives 823543 for the
product sought: for the sum is the logarithm of the product
required; and its integral part 5 shows that the product is
composed of 6 figures; which are found as above.

<span class="art">255</span> But it is in the extraction of roots that logarithms
are of the greatest service; we shall therefore give an example of the
manner in which they are used in calculations
of this kind. Suppose, for example, it were required to
extract the square root of 10. Here we have only to divide
the logarithm of 10, which is 1.0000000 by 2; and the
quotient 0.5000000 is the logarithm of the root required.
Now, the number in the Tables which answers to that
logarithm is 3.16228, the square of which is very nearly
equal to 10, being only one hundred thousandth part too
great.
