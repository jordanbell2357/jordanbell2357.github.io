<span class="art">152</span> When a number has been multiplied twice by itself,
or, which is the same thing, when the square of a number
has been multiplied once more by that number, we obtain
a product which is called a cube, or a cubic number. Thus,
the cube of $$a$$ is $$aaa$$, since it is the product obtained by
multiplying $$a$$ by itself, or by $$a$$, and that square $$aa$$ again
by $$a$$.

The cubes of the natural numbers, therefore, succeed
each other in the following order:

<span class="art">153</span> If we consider the differences of those cubes, as we
did of the squares, by subtracting each cube from that
which comes after it, we obtain the following series of
numbers:

7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271.

Where we do not at first observe any regularity in them;
but if we take the respective differences of these numbers, we
find the following series:

12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60;

in which the terms, it is evident, increase always by 6.

<span class="art">154</span> After the definition we have given of a cube, it will
not be difficult to find the cubes of fractional numbers;
thus, ⅛ the cube of ½; ¹⁄₂₇ is the cube of ⅓; and ⁸⁄₂₇ is the
cube of ⅔. In the same manner, we have only to take the
cube of the numerator and that of the denominator separately,
and we shall have ²⁷⁄₆₄ for the cube of ¾.

<span class="art">155</span> If it be required to find the cube of a mixed number, we must first reduce
it to a single fraction, and then
proceed in the manner that has been described. To find,
for example, the cube of 1½, we must take that of  ³⁄₂, which
is ²⁷⁄₈ or 3⅜; also the cube of 1¼, or of the single fraction
⁵⁄₄, is ¹²⁵⁄₆₄, or 1⁶¹⁄₆₄; and the cube of 3¼, or of ¹³⁄₄,
is ²¹⁹⁷⁄₆₄, or 34²¹⁄₆₄.

<span class="art">156</span> Since $$aaa$$ is the cube of $$a$$, that of
$$ab$$ will be $$aaabbb$$;
whence we see, that if a number has two or more factors, we
may find its cube by multiplying together the cubes of those
factors. For example, as 12 is equal to 3 · 4, we multiply
the cube of 3, which is 27, by the cube of 4, which is 64,
and we obtain 1728, the cube of 12 ; and farther, the cube
of $$2a$$ is $$8aaa$$, and consequently 8 times greater than the
cube of $$a$$: likewise, the cube of $$3a$$ is $$27aaa$$; that is to say,
27 times greater than the cube of $$a$$.

<span class="art">157</span> Let us attend here also to the signs + and -. It
is evident that the cube of a positive number $$+a$$ must also
be positive, that is $$+aaa$$; but if it be required to cube a
negative number $$-a$$, it is found by first taking the square,
which is $$+aa$$, and then multiplying, according to the rule,
this square by $$-a$$, which gives for the cube required $$-aaa$$.
In this respect, therefore, it is not the same with cubic numbers
as with squares, since the latter are always positive:
whereas the cube of -1 is -1, that of -2 is -8, that of
-3 is -27, and so on.
