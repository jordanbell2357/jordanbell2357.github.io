#### Section III. "Of Ratios and Proportions." Chapter 4. "Of the Summation of Arithmetical Progressions."

412. It is often necessary also to find the sum of an
arithmetical progression. This might be done by adding
all the terms together ; but as the addition would be very
tedious, when the progression consisted of a great number
of terms, a rule has been devised, by which the sum may be
more readily obtained.

413. We shall first consider a particular given progression,
such that the first term is 2, the difference 3, the last term
29, and the number of terms 10 ;
1234 56 7 8 910
2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29.
In this progression we see that the sum of the first and
last term is 31 ; the sum of the second and the last but one
31 ; the sum of the third and the last but two 31, and so on:
hence we conclude, that the sum of any two terms equally
distant, the one from the first, and the other from the last
term, is always equal to the sum of the first and the last
term.

414. The reason of this may be easily traced; for if we
suppose the first to be «, the last z^ and the difference cZ, the
sum of the first and the last term is a -|~ ^ ' ^^^l the second
term being a -\- d, and the last but one z •— d, the sum of
these two terms is also a -\- z. Farther, the third time being
a -\- 2^, and the last but two z — 2(i, it is evident that these
two terms also, when added together, make a -{ z\ and the
demonstration may be easily extended to any other two
terms equally distant from the first and last.

415. To determine, therefore, the sum of the progression
proposed, let us write the same progression term by term,
inverted, and add the corresponding terms together, as
follows
