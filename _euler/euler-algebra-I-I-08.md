<span class="art">85</span> We have already seen, that each of the fractions,

²⁄₂, ³⁄₃, ⁴⁄₄, ⁵⁄₅, ⁶⁄₆, ⁷⁄₇, ⁸⁄₈, etc.

makes an integer, and that consequently they are all equal
to one another. The same equality prevails in the following
fractions,

²⁄₁, ⁴⁄₂, ⁶⁄₃, ⁸⁄₄, ¹⁰⁄₅, ¹²⁄₆, etc.

each of them making two integers; for the numerator of
each, divided by its denominator, gives 2. So all the fractions

³⁄₁, ⁶⁄₂, ⁹⁄₃, ¹²⁄₄, ¹⁵⁄₅, ¹⁸⁄₆, etc.

are equal to one another, since 3 is their common value.

<span class="art">86</span> We may likewise represent the value of any fraction
in an infinite variety of ways. For if we multiply both the
numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same
number, which may be assumed at pleasure, this fraction will
still preserve the same value. For this reason, all the
fractions

½, ²⁄₄, ³⁄₆, ⁴⁄₈, ⁵⁄₁₀, ⁶⁄₁₂, ⁷⁄₁₄, ⁸⁄₁₆, ⁹⁄₁₈, ¹⁰⁄₂₀, etc.

are equal, the value of each being ½. Also, 

⅓, ²⁄₆, ³⁄₉, ⁴⁄₁₂, ⁵⁄₁₅, ⁶⁄₁₈, ⁷⁄₂₁, ⁸⁄₂₄, ⁹⁄₂₇, ¹⁰⁄₃₀, etc.

are equal fractions, the value of each being ⅓. The fractions

⅔, ⁴⁄₆, ⁶⁄₉, ⁸⁄₁₂, ¹⁰⁄₁₅, ¹²⁄₁₈, ¹⁴⁄₂₁, ¹⁶⁄₂₄, etc.

have likewise all the same value. Hence we may conclude,
in general, that the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ may be represented by any
of the following expressions, each of which is equal to $$\frac{a}{b}$$; namely

$$
\frac{a}{b},\frac{2a}{2b},\frac{3a}{3b},\frac{4a}{4b},\frac{5a}{5b},\frac{6a}{6b},
\frac{7a}{7b},\textrm{etc.}
$$

<span class="art">87</span> To be convinced of this, we have only to write for the
value of the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ a certain letter $$c$$, representing by
this letter $$c$$ the quotient of the division of $$a$$ by $$b$$; and to
recollect that the multiplication of the quotient $$c$$ by the
divisor $$b$$ must give the dividend. For since $$c$$ multiplied by
$$b$$ gives $$a$$, it is evident that $$c$$ multiplied by $$2b$$ will give $$2a$$,
that $$c$$ multiplied by $$3b$$ will give $$3a$$, and that, in general, $$c$$
multiplied by $$mb$$ will give $$ma$$. Now, changing this into an
example of division, and dividing the product $$ma$$ by $$mb$$,
one of the factors, the quotient must be equal to the other
factor $$c$$; but $$ma$$ divided by $$mb$$ gives also the fraction
$$\frac{ma}{mb}$$, which is consequently equal to $$c$$; which is what was to
be proved; for $$c$$ having been assumed as the value of the
fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$, it is evident that this fraction is equal to the
fraction $$\frac{ma}{mb}$$, whatever be the value of $$m$$.

<span class="art">88</span> We have seen that every fraction may be represented
in an infinite number of forms, each of which contains the
same value; and it is evident that of all these forms, that
which is composed of the least numbers, will be most easily
miderstood. For example, we might substitute, instead of
⅔, the following fractions,

⁴⁄₆, ⁶⁄₉, ⁸⁄₁₂, ¹⁰⁄₁₅, ¹²⁄₁₈, etc.

but of all these expressions ⅔ is that of which it is easiest to
form an idea. Here therefore a problem arises, how a
fraction, such as ⁸⁄₁₂, which is not expressed by the least
possible numbers, may be reduced to its simplest form, or to
**its least terms**; that is to say, in our present example, to ⅔.

<span class="art">89</span> It will be easy to resolve this problem, if we consider
that a fraction still preserves its value, when we multiply
both its terms, or its numerator and denominator, by the
same number. For from this it also follows, that if we
divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the
same number, the fraction will still preserve the same value.
This is made more evident by means of the general expression $$\frac{ma}{mb}$$;
for if we divide both the numerator $$ma$$ and
the denominator $$mb$$ by the number $$m$$, we obtain the fraction
$$\frac{a}{b}$$, which, as was before proved, is equal to $$\frac{ma}{mb}$$.

<span class="art">90</span> In order therefore to reduce a given fraction to its
least terms, it is required to find a number, by which both
the numerator and denominator may be divided. Such a
number is called a **common divisor**; and as long as we can
find a common divisor to the numerator and the denominator,
it is certain that the fraction may be reduced to a lower
form; but, on the contrary, when we see that, except unity,
no other common divisor can be found, this shows that the
fraction is already in its simplest form.

<span class="art">91</span> To make this more clear, let us consider the fraction
⁴⁸⁄₁₂₀. We see immediately that both the terms are divisible
by 2, and that there results the fraction ²⁴⁄₆₀; which may also
be divided by 2, and reduced to ¹²⁄₃₀; and as this likewise
has 2 for a common divisor, it is evident that it may be reduced to ⁶⁄₁₅.
But now we easily perceive, that the numerator and denominator are still divisible by 3;
performing this division, therefore, we obtain the fraction ⅖, which is
equal to the fraction proposed, and gives the simplest expression to which it can be reduced;
for 2 and 5 have no common divisor but 1, which cannot diminish these numbers
any farther.

<span class="art">92</span> This property of fractions preserving an invariable
value, whether we divide or multiply the numerator and
denominator by the same number, is of the greatest importance,
and is the principal foundation of the doctrine of
fractions. For example, we can seldom add together two
fractions, or subtract the one from the other, before we have,
by means of this property, reduced them to other forms;
that is to say, to expressions whose denominators are equal.
Of this we shall treat in the following chapter.

<span class="art">93</span> We will conclude the present, however, by remarking,
that all whole numbers may also be represented by fractions.
For example, 6 is the same as ⁶⁄₁, because 6 divided by 1
makes 6; we may also, in the same manner, express the
number 6 by the fractions ¹²⁄₂, ¹⁸⁄₃, ²⁴⁄₄, ³⁶⁄₆, and an infinite
number of others, which have the same value.
