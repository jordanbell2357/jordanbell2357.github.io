<span class="art">488</span> Compound Relations are obtained by multiplying
the terms of two or more relations, the antecedents by the
antecedents, and the consequents by the consequents; we
then say, that the relation between those two products is
compounded of the relations given.

Thus the relations $$a : b$$, $$c : d$$, $$e : f$$ give the compound
relation $$ace : bdf$$.

<span class="art">489</span> A relation continuing always the same, when we
divide both its terms by the same number, in order to
abridge it, we may greatly facilitate the above composition
by comparing the antecedents and the consequents, for the
purpose of making such reductions as we performed in the
last chapter.

For example, we find the compound relation of the following given relations thus:

Relations given 12 : 25, 28 : 33, and 55 : 56.

Which becomes

(12·28·55) : (25·33·56) = 2 : 5

by cancelling the common divisors.

So that 2 : 5 is the compound relation required.

<span class="art">490</span> The same operation is to be performed, when it is
required to calculate generally by letters; and the most remarkable case is that in which each antecedent is equal to
the consequent of the preceding relation. If the given relations are

$$
\begin{gather}
a:b\\
b:c\\
c:d\\
d:e\\
e:a
\end{gather}
$$

the compound relation is 1 : 1.

<span class="art">491</span> The utility of these principles will be perceived,
when it is observed, that the relation between two square
fields is compounded of the relations of the lengths and
the breadths.

Let the two fields, for example, be A and B; A having
500 feet in length by 60 feet in breadth; the length of B
being 360 feet, and its breadth 100 feet; the relation of the
lengths will be 500 : 360, and that of the breadths 60 : 100.
So that we have

(500·60) : (360·100) = 5 : 6

Wherefore the field A is to the field B, as 5 to 6.

<span class="art">492</span> Again, let the field A be 720 feet long, 88 feet
broad ; and let the field B be 660 feet long, and 90 feet
broad ; the relations will be compounded in the following
manner

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Relation of the lengths</td>
    <td>720 : 660</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Relation of the breadths</td>
    <td>88 : 90</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

and by cancelling, the Relation of the fields A and B is 16 : 15.

<span class="art">493</span> Farther, if it be required to compare two rooms
with respect to the space, or contents, wc observe, that that
relation is compounded of three relations; namely, that of
the lengths, breadths, and heights. Let there be, for example, a room A,
whose length is 36 feet, breadth 16 feet, and height 14 feet, and a room B,
whose length is 42 feet, breadth 24 feet, and height 10 feet; we shall have these
three relations

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>For the length</td>
    <td>36 : 42</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the breadth</td>
    <td>16 : 24</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the height</td>
    <td>14 : 10</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

And cancelling the common measures, these become 4 : 5.
So that the contents of the room A, is to the contents of the
room B, as 4 to 5.

<span class="art">494</span> When the relations which we compound in this
manner are equal, there result multiplicate relations. Namely,
two equal relations give a *duplicate ratio*, or ratio of the
squares; three equal relations produce the *triplicate ratio*,
or ratio of the cubes; and so on. For example, the relations
$$a : b$$ and $$a : b$$ give the compound relation $$a^2 : b^2$$;
wherefore we say, that the squares are in the duplicate ratio
of their roots. And the ratio $$a : b$$ multiplied twice, giving
the ratio $$a^3 : b^3$$, we say that the cubes are in the triplicate
ratio of their roots.

<span class="art">495</span> Geometry teaches, that two circular spaces are in the
duplicate relation of their diameters; this means, that they
are to each other as the squares of their diameters.

Let A be such a space, having its diameter 45 feet, and
B another circular space, whose diameter is 30 feet; the first
space will be to the second as 45 · 45 is to 30 · 30; or,
compounding these two equal relations, as 9 : 4. Therefore
the two areas are to each other as 9 to 4.

<span class="art">496</span> It is also demonstrated, that the solid contents of
spheres are in the ratio of the cubes of their diameters: so
that the diameter of a globe, A, being 1 foot, and the
diameter of a globe, B, being 2 feet, the solid content of A
will be to that of B, as $$1^3 : 2^3$$;
or as 1 to 8. If, therefore,
the spheres are formed of the same substance, the latter will
weigh 8 times as much as the former.

<span class="art">497</span> It is evident that we may in this manner find the
weight of cannon balls, their diameters, and the weight of
one, being given. For example, let there be the ball A,
whose diameter is 2 inches, and weight 5 pounds; and if the
weight of another ball be required, whose diameter is 8
inches, we have this proportion,

$$2^3:8^3::5:320 \quad \textrm{pounds},$$

which gives the weight of the ball B: and for another ball
C, whose diameter is 15 inches, we should have,

$$2^3:15^3::5:2109\frac{3}{8} \quad \textrm{lb.}$$

<span class="art">498</span> When the ratio of two fractions, as
$$\frac{a}{b}:\frac{c}{d}$$, is reb a
quired, we may always express it in integer numbers; for
we have only to multiply the two fractions by $$bd$$, in order
to obtain the ratio $$ad:bc$$, which is equal to the other; and
from hence results the proportion $$\frac{a}{b}:\frac{c}{d}::ad:bc$$.
If, therefore, $$ad$$ and $$bc$$ have common divisors, the ratio may
be reduced to fewer terms. Thus

$$\frac{15}{24}:\frac{25}{36}::(15\cdot 36):(24\cdot 25)::9:10.$$

<span class="art">499</span> If we wished to know the ratio of the fractions
$$\frac{1}{a}$$ and $$\frac{1}{b}$$, it is evident that we should have
$$\frac{1}{a}:\frac{1}{b}::b:a$$; which is expressed by saying, that two fractions,
which have unity for their numerator, are in the **reciprocal**, or inverse ratio of their
denominators: and the same thing is said of two fractions which have any common numerator;
for $$\frac{c}{a}:\frac{c}{b}::b:a$$. But if two fractions have their denominators equal,
as $$\frac{a}{c}:\frac{b}{c}$$, they are in the **direct ratio** of the numerators;
namely, as $$a:b$$. Thus, ⅜ : ³⁄₁₆ ∷ ⁶⁄₁₆ : ³⁄₁₆, or 6 : 3 ∷ 2 : 1, and
¹⁰⁄₇ : ¹⁵⁄₇ ∷ 10 : 15, or 2 : 3.

<span class="art">500</span> It has been observed, in the free descent of bodies,
that a body falls about 16 English feet in a second, that in
two seconds of time it falls from the height of 64 feet, and in
three seconds it falls 144 feet. Hence it is concluded, that
the heights are to each other as the squares of the times;
and, reciprocally, that the times are in the *subduplicate ratio*
of the heights, or as the square roots of the heights.

If, therefore, it be required to determine how long a stone
will be in falling from the height of 2304 feet; we have
16 : 2304 ∷ 1 : 144, the square of the time; and consequently
the time required is 12 seconds.

<span class="art">501</span> If it be required to determine how far, or through
what height, a stone will pass by descending for the space of
an hour, or 3600 seconds; we must say,

$$1^2:3600^2 :: 16:207360000 \quad \textrm{feet},$$

the height required.

Which being reduced is found equal to 39272 miles; and
consequently nearly five times greater than the diameter of
the earth.

<span class="art">502</span> It is the same with regard to the price of precious
stones, which are not sold in the proportion of their weight;
every body knows that their prices follow a much greater
ratio. The rule for diamonds is, that the price is in the
duplicate ratio of the weight; that is to say, the ratio of
the prices is equal to the square of the ratio of the weights.
The weight of diamonds is expressed in carats, and a carat
is equivalent to 4 grains; if, therefore, a diamond of one
carat is worth 10 livres, a diamond of 100 carats will be
worth as many times 10 livres as the square of 100 contains
1; so that we shall have, according to the Rule of Three,

1 : 10000 ∷ 10 : 100000 liv.

There is a diamond in Portugal which weighs 1680 carats;
its price will be found, therefore, by making

$$1^2 : 1680^2 :: 10 : 28224000 \quad \textrm{livres}.$$

<span class="art">503</span> The posts, or mode of travelling, in France, furnish
sufficient examples of compound ratios; because the price is
regulated by the compound ratio of the number of horses,
and the number of leagues, or posts. Thus, for example,
if one horse cost 20 sous per post, it is required to find how
much must be paid for 28 horses for 4½ posts.

We write first the ratio of the horses 1 : 28

Under this ratio we put that of the stages 2 : 9

And, compounding the two ratios, we have 2 : 252

Or, by abridging the two terms, 1 : 126 ∷ 1 liv. to 126 fr.
or 42 crowns.

Again, If I pay a ducat for eight horses for 3 miles, how
much must I pay for thirty horses for four miles? The
calculation is as follows:

8 : 30 and 3 : 4

By compounding these two ratios, and abridging,

1 : 5 ∷ 1 duc. : 5 ducats; the sum required.

<span class="art">504</span> The same composition occurs when workmen are to
be paid, since those payments generally follow the ratio
compounded of the number of workmen and that of the days
which they have been employed.

If, for example, 25 sous per day be given to one mason,
and it is required what must be paid to 24 masons who have
worked for 50 days, we state the calculation thus

1 : 24

1 : 50

Compounding these relations,

1 : 1200 ∷ 25 : 30000 sous, or 1500 francs.

In these examples, five things being given, the rule which
serves to resolve them is called, in books of arithmetic, The
Rule of Five, or Double Rule of Three.
