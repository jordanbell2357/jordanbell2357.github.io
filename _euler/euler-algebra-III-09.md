477. This theory is so useful in the common occurrences
of life, that scarcely any person can do without it. There
is always a proportion between ])rices and commodities ; and
when difl'erent kinds of money are the subject of exchange,
the whole consists in determining their mutual relations.
The examples furnished by these reflections will be very
proper for illustrating the principles of proportion, and
shewing their utility by the application of them.



478. If we wished to know, for example, the relation
between two kinds of money; suppose a *Louis d'or* and
a *ducat*: we must first know the value of those pieces when
compared with others of the same kind. Thus, a Louis d'or being,
at Berlin, worth 5 Reichsthaler and 8 Groschen,[^1] and
a ducat being worth 3 Reichsthaler, we may reduce these two
values to one denomination; either to Reichsthaler, which
gives the proportion

[^1]: 1 Reichsthaler (*Rthl.*) = 24 Groschen (*Gr.*).

1 *L.* : 1 *D.* ∷ 5⅓ *Rthl.* : 3 *Rthl.*,

or = 16:9; or to Groschen, in which case we have

1 *L.* : 1 *D.* = 128:72 = 16:9,

which proportions evidently give the true relation of
the Louis d'or to the ducat; for the equality of the products
of the extremes and the means gives, in both cases,
9 Louis d'or = 16 ducats;
and, by means of this comparison, we may
change any sum of Louis d'or into ducats, and vice-versa.
Thus, suppose it were required to find how many ducats
there are in 1000 Louis d'or, we have this proportion:

9 *L.* : 1000 *L.* ∷ 16 *D.* : 1777⁷⁄₉ *D.*,

the number sought. If, on the contrary, it were required to find how many
Louis d'or there are in 1000 ducats, we have the following
proportion:

16 *D.* : 1000 *D.* ∷ 9 *L.* : 562½ *L.*,

the answer.

479. At Petersburg the value of the ducat varies, and
depends on the course of exchange; which course determines
the value of the ruble in Dutch stuivers, 105 of
which make a ducat. So that when the exchange is at 45
stuivers per ruble, we have this proportion

1 *Rbl.* : 1 *D.* = 45:105 = 3:7;

and hence this equality, 7 rubles = 3 ducats.

Hence again we shall find the value of a ducat in rubles;
for

3 *D.* : 7 *Rbl.* ∷ 1 *D.* : 2⅓ *Rbl.*;

that is, 1 ducat is equal to 2⅓ rubles.

But if the exchange were at 50 stuivers, the proportion
would be,

50:105 ∷ 10:21;

which would give 21 rubles = 10 ducats; whence
1 ducat = 2⅒ rubles. Lastly, when the exchange is at 44 stuivers,
we have

44:105 ∷ 1 : 2¹⁷⁄₄₄
