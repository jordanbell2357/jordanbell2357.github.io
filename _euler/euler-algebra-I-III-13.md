<span class="art">540</span> We are accustomed to express the interest of any
principal by *per cents*, signifying how much interest is annually paid for the sum of 100 pounds.
And it is very usual to put out the principal sum at 5 per cent, that is, on
such terms, that we receive 5 pounds interest for every 100
pounds principal. Nothing therefore is more easy than to
calculate the interest for any sum; for we have only to say,
according to the Rule of Three:

As 100 is to the principal proposed, so is the rate *per cent* to the interest required. Let the principal,
for example, be 860*l.*, its annual interest is found by this proportion;

100:5::860:43.

Therefore 43*l.* is the annual interest.

<span class="art">541</span> We shall not dwell any longer on examples of
Simple Interest, but pass on immediately to the calculation
of Compound Interest; where the chief subject of inquiry
is, to what sum does a given principal amount, after a
certain number of years, the interest being annually added
to the principal. In order to resolve this question, we begin
with the consideration, that 100*l.* placed out at 5 per cent,
becomes, at the end of a year, a principal of 105*l.*: therefore
let the principal be $$a$$; its amount, at the end of the year,
will be found, by saying; As 100 is to $$a$$, so is 105 to the
answer; which gives

$$\dfrac{105a}{100} = \dfrac{21a}{20} = \frac{21}{20} \cdot a = a + \frac{1}{20}a.$$

<span class="art">542</span> So that, when we add to the original principal its
twentieth part, we obtain the amount of the principal
at the end of the first year: and adding to this its twentieth
part, we know the amount of the given principal at the end
of two years, and so on. It is easy, therefore, to compute the
successive and annual increases of the principal, and to continue this calculation to any length.

<span class="art">543</span> Suppose, for example, that a principal, which is at
present 1000*l.*, is put out at five per cent; that the interest
is added every year to the principal; and that it were required to find its amount at any time. As this calculation
must lead to fractions, we shall employ decimals, but without carrying them farther than the thousandth parts of a
pound, since smaller parts do not at present enter into consideration.

which sums are formed by always adding ¹⁄₂₀ of the preceding principal.

<span class="art">544</span> We may continue the same method, for any number
of years; but when this number is very great, the calculation becomes long and tedious; but it may always be
abridged, in the following manner:

Let the present principal be $$a$$, and since a principal of
20*l.* amounts to 21*l.* at the end of a year, the principal $$a$$ will
amount to $$\frac{21}{20}\cdot a$$ at the end of a year: and the same principal
will amount, the following year, to $$\frac{21^2}{20^2}\cdot a=\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^2 \cdot a$$.
Also, this principal of two years will amount to $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^3 \cdot a$$, the
year after: which will therefore be the principal of three
years; and still increasing in the same manner, the given
principal will amount to $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^4 \cdot a$$ at the end of four years;
to $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^5 \cdot a$$, at the end of five years; and after a century,
it will amount to $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^{100} \cdot a$$; so that, in general, $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot a$$
will be the amount of this principal, after $$n$$ years; and this
formula will serve to determine the amount of the principal,
after any number of years,
    
<span class="art">545</span> The fraction ²¹⁄₂₀, which is used in this calculation,
depends on the interest having been reckoned at 5 per cent.,
and on ²¹⁄₂₀ being equal to ¹⁰⁵⁄₁₀₀. But if the interest were
estimated at 6 per cent, the principal $$a$$ would amount to
$$\frac{106}{100}\cdot a$$, at the end of a year; to $$\left(\frac{106}{100}\right)^2\cdot a$$, at the end of
two years; and to $$\left(\frac{106}{100}\right)^n \cdot a$$, at the end of $$n$$ years.
    
If the interest is only at 4 per cent, the principal $$a$$ will
amount only to $$\left(\frac{104}{100}\right)^n \cdot a$$, after $$n$$ years.
    
<span class="art">546</span> When the principal $$a$$, as well as the number of
years, is given, it is easy to resolve these formulae by logarithms. For if the question be according to our first supposition,
we shall take the logarithm of $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot a$$, which is

$$=\log \left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n + \log a;$$

because the given formula is the
product of $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n$$ and $$a$$. Also, as $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n$$ is a power, we shall
have $$\log \left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n=n \log \frac{21}{20}$$: so that the logarithm of the
amount required is $$n \log \frac{21}{20} + \log a$$; and farther, the
logarithm of the fraction $$\frac{21}{20}$$ equals $$\log 21 - \log 20$$.
    
<span class="art">547</span> Let now the principal be lOOO*l.* and let it be required
to find how much this principal will amount to at the end of
100 years, reckoning the interest at 5 per cent.
    
Here we have $$n = 100$$; and, consequently, the logarithm
of the amount required will be $$100\log \frac{21}{20} + \log 1000$$,
which is calculated thus:

Subtracting

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\log 21&=1.3222193\\
\log 20&=1.3010300\\ \hline
\log \frac{21}{20}&=0.0211893.
\end{array}
$$

Multiplying by 100

$$100\log \frac{21}{20} = 0.021189300.$$

Adding $$\log 1000$$,

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
100\log \frac{21}{20}&=0.021189300\\
\log 1000&=3.0000000\\ \hline
100\log \frac{21}{20}+\log 1000&=5.1189300
\end{array}
$$

which is the logarithm of the principal required.

We perceive, from the characteristic of this logarithm,
that the principal required will be a number consisting of
six figures, and it is found to be 131501*l.*
    
<span class="art">548</span> Again, suppose a principal of 3452*l.* were put out at
6 per cent, what would it amount to at the end of 64 years?
    
We have here $$a=3452$$, and $$n=64$$. Wherefore the
logarithm of the amount sought is $$64\log \frac{53}{50}+\log 3452$$, which is calculated thus:
    
Subtracting

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\log 53&=1.7242759\\
\log 50&=1.6989700\\ \hline
\log \frac{53}{50}&=0.0253059.
\end{array}
$$

Multiplying by 64
    
$$64\log \frac{53}{50} = 1.6195776.$$

Adding $$\log 3452$$,

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
64\log \frac{53}{50}&=1.6195776\\
\log 3452&=3.5380708\\ \hline
64\log \frac{53}{50}+\log 3452&=5.1576484
\end{array}
$$
    
And taking the number of this logarithm, we find the
amount required equal to 143763*l.*

<span class="art">549</span> When the number of years is very great,
as it is required to multiply this number by the logarithm of a fraction,
a considerable error might arise from the logarithms in
the Tables not being calculated beyond 7 figures of decimals;
for which reason it will be necessary to employ logarithms
carried to a greater number of figures, as in the following
example.
    
A principal of 1*l.* being placed at 5 per cent., compound
interest, for 500 years, it is required to find to what sum this
principal will amount, at the end of that period.

We have here $$a = 1$$ and $$n = 500$$; consequently, the
logarithm of the principal sought is equal to $$500\log\frac{21}{20}+\log 1$$,
which produces this calculation:

Subtracting

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\log 21&=1.322219294733919\\
\log 20&=1.301029995663981\\ \hline
\log \frac{21}{20}&= 0.021189299069938
\end{array}
$$

Multiplying by 500

$$500\log \frac{21}{20}=10.594649534969000,$$

the logarithm of the amount required; which will be found equal to
39323200000*l.*

<span class="art">550</span> If we not only add the interest annually to the principal,
but also increase it every year by a new sum $$b$$, the
original principal, which we call $$a$$, would increase each year
in the following manner:
    
<table>

    <td>\(+\cdots\)</td>
    <td>\(+\frac{21}{20}b\)</td>
    <td>\(+b\)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This amount evidently consists of two parts, of which the
first is $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^na$$; and the other, taken inversely, forms the
series

$$b+\frac{21}{20}b+\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^2b+\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^3b+\cdots+
\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^{n-1}b;$$

which
series is evidently a geometrical progression, the ratio of
which is equal to ²¹⁄₂₀, and we shall therefore find its sum, by
first multiplying the last term
$$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^{n-1}b$$ by the exponent ²¹⁄₂₀;
which gives $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^nb$$.
Then, subtracting the first term $$b$$, there
remains $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^nb-b$$;
and, lastly, dividing by the exponent
minus 1, that is to say by ¹⁄₂₀, we shall find the sum required
to be $$20\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^nb-20b$$;
therefore the amount sought is,

$$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^na + 20\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^nb-20b = \left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot(a+20b)-20b.$$
     
<span class="art">551</span> The resolution of this formula requires us to calculate, separately,
its first term $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot (a+20b)$$, which is
$$n\log \frac{21}{20}+\log(a+20b)$$; for the number which answers
to this logarithm in the Tables, will be the first term; and
if from this we subtract $$20b$$, we shall have the amount
sought.
    
<span class="art">552</span> A person has a principal of 1000*l.* placed out at
five per cent, compound interest, to which he adds annually
100*l.* beside the interest: what will be the amount of this
principal at the end of twenty-five years?

We have here $$a=1000$$; $$b=100$$; $$n=25$$; the operation is therefore as follows:

$$\log \frac{21}{20} = 0.021189299$$

Multiplying by 25, we have

$$25 \log \frac{21}{20} = 0.5297324750$$

$$\log(a+20b)=3.4771213135$$

And the sum is

$$25 \log \frac{21}{20}+\log(a+20b) = 4.0068537885.$$

So that the first part, or the number which answers to this
logarithm, is 10159.1, and if we subtract $$20b = 2000$$, we
find that the principal in question, after twenty-five years,
will amount to 8159.1*l.*

<span class="art">553</span> Since then this principal of 1000*l.* is always increasing, and after twenty-five years amounts to
8159⅒*l.* we may require, in how many years it will amount to 1000000*l.*

Let $$n$$ be the number of years required: and, since
$$a=1000$$, $$b=100$$, the principal will be, at the end of $$n$$ years,
$$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot (3000) - 2000$$, which sum must make
1000000; from it therefore results this equation;

$$3000\cdot \left(\frac{21}{20} \right)^n -2000 = 1000000;$$

And adding 2000 to both sides, we have

$$3000\cdot \left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n = 1002000.$$

Then dividing both sides by 3000, we have $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n = 334$$.

Taking the logarithms, $$n\log \frac{21}{20} = \log 334$$; and dividing by
$$\log \frac{21}{20}$$, we obtain $$n=\dfrac{\log 334}{\log \frac{21}{20}}$$.
Now, $$\log 334=2.5237465$$, and $$\log \frac{21}{20} = 0.0211893$$; therefore
$$n=\dfrac{2.5237465}{0.0211893}$$; and, lastly, if we multiply the two terms of this
fraction by 10000000, we shall have $$n=\dfrac{25237465}{211893}$$ = 119 years, 1 month, 7 days;
and this is the time, in which the principal of 1000*l.* will be increased to
1000000*l.*

<span class="art">554</span> But if we supposed that a person, instead of annually
increasing his principal by a certain fixed sum, diminished
it, by spending a certain sum every year, we should have
the following gradations, as the values of that principal $$a$$,
year after year, supposing it put out at 5 per cent, compound interest, and representing
the sum which is annually
taken from it by $$b$$:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>after 1 year</td>
    <td>\(\frac{21}{20}a\)</td>

<span class="art">555</span> This principal consists of two parts, one of which is
$$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot a$$, and the other, which must be subtracted from it,
taking the terms inversely, forms the following geometrical
progression:

$$b+\frac{21}{20}b+\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^2b+\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^3b+\cdots+
\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^{n-1}b;$$

Now we have already found (<span class="artref">Art. 550</span>) that the sum of this
progression is
$$20\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^nb-20b$$; if, therefore, we subtract this
quantity from $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot a$$, we shall have for
the principal required, after $$n$$ years,

$$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n \cdot (a-2b)+20b.$$

<span class="art">556</span> We might have deduced this formula immediately
from that of <span class="artref">Art. 550</span>.
For, in the same manner as we annually added the sum $$b$$,
in the former supposition; so, in
the present, we subtract the same sum $$b$$ every year. We
have therefore only to put in the former formula, $$-b$$ everywhere,
instead of $$+b$$. But it must here be particularly remarked, that if $$20b$$ is greater than $$a$$,
the first part becomes
negative, and, consequently, the principal will continually
diminish. This will be easily perceived; for if we annually
take away from the principal more than is added to it by the
interest, it is evident that this principal must continually become less,
and at last it will be absolutely reduced to
nothing; as will appear from the following example:

<span class="art">557</span> A person puts out a principal of 100000*l.* at 5 per
cent interest; but he spends annually 6000*l.*; which is
more than the interest of his principal, the latter being only
5000*l.*; consequently, the principal will continually diminish;
and it is required to determine, in what time it will be all
spent.

Let us suppose the number of years to be $$n$$,
and since $$a=100000$$, and $$b=6000$$, we know that after $$n$$ years
the amount of the principal will be $$-20000\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n + 120000$$,
or $$120000-20000\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n$$, where the factor,
-20000, is the result of $$a-20b$$; or 100000 - 120000.

So that the principal will become nothing, when $$20000\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n$$
amounts to 120000; or when $$20000\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n = 120000$$. Now,
dividing both sides by 20000, we have $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n=6$$;
and taking the logarithm, we have $$n \log \frac{21}{20} = \log 6$$; then
dividing by $$\log \frac{21}{20}$$, we have
$$n=\dfrac{\log 6}{\log \frac{21}{20}}$$, or
$$n=\dfrac{0.7781513}{0.0211893}$$; and, consequently, $$n$$ = 36 years, 8 months, 22 days;
at the end of which time, no part of the principal
will remain.

<span class="art">558</span> It will here be proper also to show how,
from the
same principles, we may calculate interest for times shorter
than whole years. For this purpose, we make use of the
formula $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^n\cdot a$$ already found, which expresses the amount
of a principal, at 5 per cent, compound interest, at the end
of $$n$$ years; for if the time be less than a year, the exponent
$$n$$ becomes a fraction, and the calculation is performed by
logarithms as before. If, for example, the amount of a
principal at the end of one day were required, we should
make $$n=\frac{1}{365}$$; if after two days, $$n=\frac{2}{365}$$, and so on.

<span class="art">559</span> Suppose the amount of 100000*l.* for 8 days were
required, the interest being at 5 per cent.

Here $$a=100000$$, and $$n=\frac{8}{365}$$, consequently, the amount
sought is $$\left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^{\frac{8}{365}} \cdot 100000$$;
the logarithm of which quantity is

$$\log \left(\frac{21}{20}\right)^{\frac{8}{365}}+\log 10000=\frac{8}{365} \log \frac{21}{20} + \log 100000.$$

Now, $$\log \frac{21}{20} = 0.0211893$$, which, multiplied by
$$\frac{8}{365}$$, gives 0.0004644, to which adding

$$\log 100000=5.0000000$$

the sum is

$$\frac{8}{365}\log \frac{21}{20}+\log 100000=5.0004644$$

The natural number of this logarithm is found to be 100107. So that, subtracting the principal, 100000 from
this amount, the interest, for eight days, is 107*l.*

<span class="art">560</span> To this subject belong also the calculation of the
present value of a sum of money, which is payable only after
a term of years. For as 20*l.*, in ready money, amounts to
21*l.* in a year; so, reciprocally, a sum of 21*l.*, which cannot
be received till the end of one year, is really worth only 20*l.*
If, therefore, we express, by $$a$$, a sum whose payment is due
at the end of a year, the present value of this sum is $$\frac{20}{21}a$$;
and therefore to find the present worth of a principal $$a$$,
payable a year hence, we must multiply it by ²⁰⁄₂₁; to find its
value two years before the time of payment, we multiply it by
$$\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^2a$$; and in general, its value, $$n$$ years before the time
of payment, will be expressed by $$\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^na$$.

<span class="art">561</span> Suppose, for example, a man has to receive for
five successive years, an annual rent of 100*l.* and that he
wishes to give it up for ready money, the interest being at
5 per cent; it is required to find how much he is to receive. Here the calculations may be made in the following
manner:

For 100*l.* due

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>after 1 year, he receives</td>
    <td>95.239</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>after 2 years, he receives</td>
    <td>90.704</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>after 3 years, he receives</td>
    <td>86.385</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>after 4 years, he receives</td>
    <td>82.272</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>after 5 years, he receives</td>
    <td>78.355</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sum of the 5 terms =</td>
    <td>432.955</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

So that the possessor of the rent can claim, in ready money,
only 432.955*l.*

<span class="art">562</span> If such a rent were to last a greater number of
years, the calculation, in the manner we have performed it,
would become very tedious; but in that case it may be
facilitated as follows:

Let the annual rent be $$a$$, commencing at present and
lasting $$n$$ years, it will be actually worth

$$a+\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)a+\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^2a+\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^3a+\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^4a+\cdots+\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^na.$$

Which is a geometrical progression, and the whole is reduced to finding its sum. We therefore multiply the last
term by the exponent, the product of which is $$\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^{n+1}a$$;
then, subtracting the first term, there remains
$$\left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^{n+1}a-a$$;
and, lastly, dividing by the exponent minus 1, that is, by -¹⁄₂₁,
or, which amounts to the same, multiplying by -21,
we shall have the sum required,

$$-21\cdot \left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^{n+1}\cdot a + 21a,$$

or,

$$21a-21\cdot \left(\frac{20}{21}\right)^{n+1}\cdot a;$$

and the value of the second term, which it is required to
subtract, is easily calculated by logarithms.
