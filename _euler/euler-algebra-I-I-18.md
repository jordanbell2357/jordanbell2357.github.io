<span class="art">189</span> Since the square root of a given number is a number,
whose square is equal to that given number; and since
the cube root of a given number is a number, whose cube is
equal to that given number; it follows that any number
whatever being given, we may always suppose such roots of
it, that the fourth, or the fifth, or any other power of them,
respectively, may be equal to the given number.
To distinguish these different kinds of roots better, we shall call the
square root, the second root; and the cube root, the third
root; because according to this denomination we may call
the fourth root, that whose biquadrate is equal to a given
number; and the fifth root, that whose fifth power is equal
to a given number, etc.

<span class="art">190</span> As the square, or second root, is marked by the sign
√, and the cubic, or third root, by the sign ∛, so the fourth
root is represented by the sign ∜; the fifth root by the sign
$$\sqrt[5]{\vphantom{1}}$$; and so on. It is evident that, according to this method
of expression, the sign of the square root ought to be $$\sqrt[2]{\vphantom{1}}$$:
but as of all roots this occurs most frequently, it has been
agreed, for the sake of brevity, to omit the number 2 as the
sign of this root. So that when the radical sign has no number prefixed to it,
this always shows that the square root is
meant.

<span class="art">191</span> To explain this matter still better, we shall here
exhibit the different roots of the number a, with their respective values

$$\surd a$$ is the 2nd root of $$a$$,  
$$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is the 3rd root of $$a$$,  
$$\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is the 4th root of $$a$$,  
$$\sqrt[5]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is the 5th root of $$a$$,  
$$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is the 6th root of $$a$$,

and so on.

So that, conversely,

The 2nd power of $$\surd a$$ is $$a$$,  
The 3rd power of $$\sqrt[3]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is $$a$$,  
The 4th power of $$\sqrt[4]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is $$a$$,  
The 5rd power of $$\sqrt[5]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is $$a$$,  
The 6rd power of $$\sqrt[6]{\vphantom{1}} a$$ is $$a$$,

and so on.

<span class="art">192</span> Whether the number $$a$$ therefore be great or small,
we know what value to affix to all these roots of different
degrees.

It must be remarked also, that if we substitute unity for $$a$$,
all those roots remain constantly 1; because all the powers
of 1 have unity for their value. If the number a be greater
than 1, all its roots will also exceed unity. Lastly, if that
number be less than 1, all its roots will also be less than
unity.

<span class="art">193</span> When the number $$a$$ is positive, we know from what
was before said of the square and cube roots, that all the
other roots may also be determined, and will be real and
possible numbers.

But if the number $$a$$ be negative, its second, fourth, sixth,
and all its even roots, become impossible, or imaginary numbers;
because all the powers of an even order, whether of
positive or of negative numbers, are affected by the sign +:
whereas the third, fifth, seventh, and all its odd roots, become
negative, but rational; because the odd powers of negative
numbers are also negative.

<span class="art">194</span> We have here also an inexhaustible source of new
kinds of surds, or irrational quantities; for whenever the
number $$a$$ is not really such a power, as some one of the
foregoing indices represents, or seems to require, it is impossible
to express that root either in whole numbers or in
fractions; and, consequently, it must be classed among the
numbers which are called irrational.
