<span class="art">31</span> We shall now proceed to indeterminate equations, in
which it is required to find two unknown quantities, one of
them being multiplied by the other, or raised to a power
higher than the first, whilst the other is found only in the
first degree. It is evident that equations of this kind may
be represented by the following general expression:

$$a+bx+cy+dx^2+exy+fx^3+gx^2y+hx^4+kx^3y+\textrm{etc.}=0.$$

As in this equation $$y$$ does not exceed the first degree, that
letter is easily determined; but here, as before, the values
both of $$x$$ and of $$y$$ must be assigned in integer numbers.

We shall consider some of those cases, beginning with the
easiest.

<span class="art">32</span> *Question 1.* To find two such numbers, that their
product added to their sum may be 79.

Call the numbers sought $$x$$ and $$y$$: then we must have
$$xy+x+y=79$$; so that $$xy+y=79-x$$, and

$$y=\dfrac{79-x}{x+1} = -1 + \dfrac{80}{x+1},$$

from which we see that $$x+1$$ must be a divisor of 80. Now, 80 having
several divisors, we shall also have several values of $$x$$, as the
following Table will show:

<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>8</th>
<th>10</th>
<th>16</th>
<th>20</th>
<th>40</th>
<th>80</th>

<tr>
<td>therefore \(x\) =</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>9</td>

<tr>
<td>and \(y\) =</td>
<td>79</td>
<td>39</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

But as the answers in the bottom line are the same as
those in the first, inverted, we have, in reality, only the five
following; namely,

<table>
<tr>
<td>\(x\) =</td>
<td>0,</td>
<td>1,</td>
<td>3,</td>
<td>4,</td>
<td>7,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(y\) =</td>
<td>79,</td>
<td>39,</td>
<td>19,</td>
<td>15,</td>
<td>9.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<span class="art">33</span> In the same manner, we may also resolve the general
equation $$xy+ax+by=c$$; for we shall have $$xy+by=c-ax$$,
and $$y=\dfrac{c-ax}{x+b}$$, or $$y=\dfrac{ab+c}{x+b}-a$$; that is to say,
$$x+b$$ must be a divisor of the known number $$ab+c$$;
so that each divisor of this number gives a value of $$x$$. If
we therefore make $$ab+c=fg$$, we have

$$y=\dfrac{fg}{x+b}-a;$$

and supposing $$x+b=f$$, or $$x=f-b$$, it is evident, that $$y=g-a$$;
and, consequently, that we have also two answers for every method of
representing the number $$ab+c$$ by a product, such as $$fg$$.
Of these two answers, one is $$x=f-b$$ and $$y=g-a$$, and the other
is obtained by making $$x+b=g$$, in which case $$x=g-b$$,
and $$y=f-a$$.

If, therefore, the equation $$xy+2x+3y=42$$ were proposed, we should have
$$a=2$$, $$b=3$$, and $$c=42$$;
consequently,

$$y=\dfrac{48}{x+3}-2.$$

Now, the number 48 may be
represented in several ways by two factors, as $$fg$$: and in each
of those cases we shall always have either $$x=f-3$$, and $$y=g-2$$;
or else $$x=g-3$$, and $$y=f-2$$. The analysis of this example is as follows:

<span class="art">34</span> The equation may be expressed still more generally,
by writing $$mxy=ax+by+c$$; where $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, amd $$m$$, are
given numbers, and it is required to find integers for $$x$$ and $$y$$
that are not known.

If we first separate $$y$$, we shall have $$y=\dfrac{ax+c}{mx-b}$$;
and removing $$x$$ from the numerator, by multiplying both sides by
$$m$$, we have

$$my = \dfrac{max+mc}{mx-b} = a + \dfrac{mc+ab}{mx-b}.$$

We have here a fraction whose numerator is a known number,
and whose denominator must be a divisor of that number;
let us therefore represent the numerator by a product
of two factors, as $$fg$$ (which may often be done in several
ways), and see if one of these factors may be compared with
$$mx-b$$, so that $$mx-b=f$$. Now, for this purpose, since
$$x=\dfrac{f+b}{m}$$, $$f+b$$ must be divisible by $$m$$; and hence
it follows, that out of the factors of $$mc+ab$$, we can employ
only those which are of such a nature, by adding $$b$$ to them,
the sums will be divisible by $$m$$. We shall illustrate this by
an example.

Let the equation be $$5xy=2x+3y+18$$. Here, we have

$$y = \dfrac{2x+18}{5x-3},\quad \textrm{and} \quad 5y = \dfrac{10x+90}{5x-3} = 2 + \dfrac{96}{5x-3};$$

it is therefore required to find those divisors of 26 which,
added to 3, will give sums divisible by 5. Now, if we consider all the divisors of 96,
which are

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 24, 32, 48, 96,

it is evident that only these three of them,
namely 2, 12, 32, will answer this condition.

Therefore,

1. If $$5x-3=2$$, we obtain $$5y=50$$, and consequently, $$x=1$$, and $$y=10$$.
2. If $$5x-3=12$$, we obtain $$5y=10$$, and consequently, $$x=3$$, and $$y=2$$.
3. If $$5x-3=32$$, we obtain $$5y=5$$, and consequently, $$x=7$$, and $$y=1$$.

<span class="art">35</span> As in this general solution we have

$$my-a=\dfrac{mc+ab}{mx-b},$$

it will be proper to observe, that if a number, contained in the formula
$$mc+ab$$, have a divisor of the form $$mx-b$$, the quotient in that
case must necessarily be contained in the formula $$my-a$$: we may
therefore express the number $$mc+ab$$ by a product, such as
$$(mx-b)\cdot (my-a)$$. For example, let $$m=12$$, $$a=5$$, $$b=7$$, and $$c=15$$,
and we have

$$12y-5=\dfrac{215}{12x-7}.$$

Now, the divisors of 215 are 1, 5, 43, 215; and we must select from these such as are
contained in the formula $$12x-7$$; or such as, by adding 7 to them, the sum may be
divisible by 12: but 5 is the only divisor that satisfies this condition; so that
$$12x-7=5$$, and $$12y-5=43$$. In the same manner, as the first of these
equations gives $$x=1$$, we also find $$y$$, in integer numbers, from
the other, namely, $$y=4$$. This property is of the greatest importance
with regard to the theory of numbers, and therefore deserves particular
attention.

<span class="art">36</span> Let us now consider also an equation of this kind,

$$xy+x^2=2x+3y=29.$$

First, it gives us

$$y=\dfrac{2x-x^2+29}{x-3},\quad \textrm{or} \quad y= -x-1+\dfrac{26}{x-3};
\quad \textrm{and} \quad y+x+1=\dfrac{26}{x-3}:$$

so that $$x-3$$ must be a divisor of 26; and, in this case, the divisors of 26 being

1, 2, 13, 26,

we obtain the following three answers:

1. $$x-3=1$$, or $$x=4$$; so that $$y+x+1=y+5=26$$, and $$y=21$$;
2. $$x-3=2$$, or $$x=5$$; so that $$y+x+1=y+6=13$$, and $$y=7$$;
3. $$x-3=13$$, or $$x=16$$; so that $$y+x+1=y+17=2$$, and $$y=-15$$.

This last value, being negative, must be omitted; and, for the same reason,
we cannot include the last case, $$x-3=26$$.

<span class="art">37</span> It would be unnecessary to analyse any more of these
formulae, in which we find only the first power of $$y$$, and
higher powers of $$x$$; for these cases occur but seldom, and,
besides, they may always be resolved by the method which
we have explained. But when $$y$$ also is raised to the second
power, or to a degree still higher, and we wish to determine
its value by the above rules, we obtain radical signs, which
contain the second, or higher powers of $$x$$; and it is then
necessary to find such values of $$x$$, as will destroy the radical
signs, or tlie irrationality. Now, the great art of Indeterminate Analysis
consists in rendering those surd, or incommensurable formulae rational:
the methods of performing which will be explained in the following chapters.
