<span class="art">402</span> We have already remarked, that a series of numbers
composed of any number of terms, which always increase, or
decrease, by the same quantity, is called an arithmetical
progression.

Thus, the natural numbers written in their order, as

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.

form an arithmetical progression, because they constantly increase by unity; and
the series

25, 22, 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4, 1, etc.

is also such a progression, since the numbers constantly decrease by 3.

<span class="art">403</span> The number, or quantity, by which the terms of an
arithmetical progression become greater or less, is called the
difference; so that when the first term and the difference
are given, we may continue the arithmetical progression to
any length.

For example, let the first term be 2, and the difference 3,
and we shall have the following increasing progression:

2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, etc.

in which each term is found by adding the difference to the preceding one.

<span class="art">404</span> It is usual to write the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, etc. above the terms of such an arithmetical progression,
in order that we may immediately perceive the rank, which
anv term holds in the progression, which numbers, when
written above the terms, are called indices; thus, the above
example will be written as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Indices</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Arithmetic Progression</td>
    <td>2,</td>
    <td>5,</td>
    <td>8,</td>
    <td>11,</td>
    <td>14,</td>
    <td>17,</td>
    <td>20,</td>
    <td>23,</td>
    <td>26,</td>
    <td>29,</td>
    <td>etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

where we see that 29 is the tenth term.

<span class="art">405</span> Let $$a$$ be the first term, and $$d$$ the difference, the
arithmetical progression will go on in the following order:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\(a\),</td>
    <td>\(a+d\),</td>
    <td>\(a+2d\),</td>
    <td>\(a+3d\),</td>
    <td>\(a+4d\),</td>
    <td>\(a+5d\),</td>
    <td>\(a+6d\),</td>
    <td>\(a+7d\),</td>
    <td>etc.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

whence it appears that any term of the progression might be easily
found, without the necessity of finding all the preceding
ones, by means only of the first term $$a$$ and the difference $$d$$;
thus, for example, the tenth term will be $$a + 9d$$, the hundredth term $$a+9d$$, and, generally,
the $n$th term will be

$$a + (n  -1)d.$$

<span class="art">406</span> When we stop at any point of the progression, it is
of importance to attend to the first and the last term, since
the index of the last term will represent the number of
terms. If, therefore, the first term be $$a$$, the difference $$d$$,
and the number of terms $$n$$, we shall have for the last term
$$a + (n  -1)d$$, which is consequently found by multiplying the
difference by the number of terms minus one, and adding
that product to the first term. Suppose,
for example, in an arithmetical progression of a
hundred terms, the first term is 4, and the difference 3; then
the last term will be 99·3 + 4 = 301.

<span class="art">407</span> When we know the first term $$a$$, and the last $$z$$, with
the number of terms $$n$$, we can find the difference $$d$$; for,
since the last term

$$z = a + (n  -1)d,$$

if we subtract a from
both sides, we obtain $$z - a = (n-1)d$$. So that by taking
the difference between the first and last term, we have the
product of the difference multiplied by the number of terms
minus 1; we have therefore only to divide $$z - a$$ by $$n - 1$$
in order to obtain the required value of the difference $$d$$,
which will be $$\dfrac{z-a}{n-1}$$. This result furnishes the following
rule: Subtract the first term from the last, divide the remainder by the number of terms minus 1, and the quotient
will be the common difference: by means of which we may
write the whole progression.

<span class="art">408</span> Suppose, for example, that we have an increasing
arithmetical progression of nine terms, whose first is 2 and
last 26, and that it is required to find the difference. We must
subtract the first term 2 from the last 26, and divide the remainder, which is 24, by
9 - 1, that is, by 8; the quotient 3 will be equal to the difference required, and the whole
progression will be:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2,</td>
    <td>5,</td>
    <td>8,</td>
    <td>11,</td>
    <td>14,</td>
    <td>17,</td>
    <td>20,</td>
    <td>23,</td>
    <td>26.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To give another example, let us suppose that the first
term is 1, the last 2, the number of terms 10, and that the
arithmetical progression, answering to these suppositions,
is required; we shall immediately have for the difference
$$\frac{2-1}{10-1}=\frac{1}{9}$$, and thence conclude that the progression is:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1,</td>
    <td>1⅑,</td>
    <td>1²⁄₉,</td>
    <td>1³⁄₉,</td>
    <td>1⁴⁄₉,</td>
    <td>1⁵⁄₉,</td>
    <td>1⁶⁄₉,</td>
    <td>1⁷⁄₉,</td>
    <td>1⁸⁄₉,</td>
    <td>2.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Another example. Let the first term be 2⅓, the last term
12½, and the number of terms 7; the difference will be

$$\frac{12\frac{1}{2}-2\frac{1}{3}}{7-1}=\frac{10\frac{1}{6}}{6} = \frac{61}{36} = 1\frac{25}{36},$$

and consequently the progression:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2⅓,</td>
    <td>4¹⁄₃₆,</td>
    <td>5¹³⁄₁₈,</td>
    <td>7⁵⁄₁₂,</td>
    <td>9⅑,</td>
    <td>10²⁹⁄₃₆,</td>
    <td>12½.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span class="art">409</span> If now the first term $$a$$, the last term $$z$$, and the difference $$d$$, are given, we may from them find the number of
terms $$n$$; for since $$z - a = (n - 1)d$$, by dividing both
sides by $$d$$, we have $$n-1 = \frac{z-a}{d}$$;
also $$n$$ being greater by
1 than $$n - 1$$, we have

$$n = \frac{z-a}{d}+1;$$

consequently the
number of terms is found by dividing the difference between
the first and the last term, or $$z -a$$, by the difference of the
progression, and adding unity to the quotient.

For example, let the first term be 4, the last 100, and the
difference 12, the number of terms will be $$\frac{100-4}{12}+1=9$$;
and these nine terms will be,

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4,</td>
    <td>16,</td>
    <td>28,</td>
    <td>40,</td>
    <td>52,</td>
    <td>64,</td>
    <td>76,</td>
    <td>88,</td>
    <td>100.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If the first term be 2, the last 6, and the difference 1⅓, the
number of terms will be $$\frac{4}{1\frac{1}{3}}+1=4$$; and these four terms
will be,

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2,</td>
    <td>3⅓,</td>
    <td>4⅔,</td>
    <td>6.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Again, let the first term be 3⅓, the last 7⅔, and the difference 1⁴⁄₉,
the number of terms will be $$\frac{7\frac{2}{3}-3\frac{1}{3}}{1\frac{4}{9}}+1=4$$;
which are,

3⅓, 4⁷⁄₉, 6²⁄₉, 7⅔.

<span class="art">410</span> It must be observed, however, that as the number
of terms is necessarily an integer, if we had not obtained
such a number for $$n$$, in the examples of the preceding
article, the questions would have been absurd.

Whenever we do not obtain an integer number for the
value of $$\frac{z-a}{d}$$, it will be impossible to resolve the question;
and consequently, in order that questions of this kind may
be possible, $$z - a$$ must be divisible by $$d$$.

<span class="art">411</span> From what has been said, it may be concluded, that
we have always four quantities, or things, to consider in an
arithmetical progression:

1. The first term, $$a$$;
2. The last term, $$z$$;
3. The difference, $$d$$; and
4. The number of terms, $$n$$.

The relations of these quantities to each other are such,
that if we know three of them, we are able to determine the
fourth; for,

1. If $$a$$, $$d$$, and $$n$$, are known, we have $$z=a+(n-1)d$$.
2. If $$z$$, $$d$$, and $$n$$, are known, we have $$a = z-(n-1)d$$.
3. If $$a$$, $$z$$, and $$n$$, are known, we have $$d = \frac{z-a}{n-1}$$.
4. If $$a$$, $$z$$, and $$d$$, are known, we have $$n=\frac{z-a}{d}=1$$.
