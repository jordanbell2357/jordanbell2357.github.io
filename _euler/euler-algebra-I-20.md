### Leonhard Euler, *Elements of Algebra* (*Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra*)

#### Section I. "Of the different Methods of calculating Simple Quantities." Chapter 20. "Of the different Methods of Calculation, and of their mutual Connection."

> **206.** Hitherto we have only explained the different methods of calculation: namely,
> addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; the involution of powers,
> and the extraction of roots. It will not be improper, therefore, in this place, to trace back
> the origin of these different methods, and to explain the connection which subsists among them;
> in order that we may satisfy ourselves whether it be possible or not for other operations
> of the same kind to exist. This inquiry will throw new light on the subjects which we have considered.
>
> In prosecuting this design, we shall make use of a new character, which may be
> employed instead of the expression that has been so often repeated, is equal to;
> this sign is =, which is read *is equal to*: thus, when I write $$a = b$$,
> this means that $$a$$ is equal to $$b$$: so, for example, 3 · 5 = 15.
>
> **207.** The first mode of calculation that presents itself to the mind, is undoubtedly addition, by
> which we add two numbers together and find their sum: let therefore $$a$$ and $$b$$
> be the two given numbers, and let their sum be expressed by the letter $$c$$, then we shall
> have $$a + b = c$$; so that when we know
> the two numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$, addition teaches us to find the number $$c$$.
