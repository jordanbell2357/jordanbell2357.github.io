<span class="art">101</span> The rule for the multiplication of a fraction by an
integer, or whole number, is to multiply the numerator
only by the given number, and not to change the denominator: thus,

2 times ½ makes ²⁄₂, or one whole;

2 times ⅓ makes ⅔; and

3 times ⅙ makes ³⁄₆, or ½;

4 times ⁵⁄₁₂ makes ²⁰⁄₁₂, or 1⁸⁄₁₂, or 1⅔.

But, instead of this rule, we may use that of dividing the
denominator by the given integer, which is preferable, when
it can be done, because it shortens the operation. Let it be
required, for example, to multiply ⁸⁄₉ by 3; if we multiply
the numerator by the given integer we obtain ²⁴⁄₉, which
product we must reduce to ⁸⁄₃. But if we do not change
the numerator, and divide the denominator by the integer,
we find immediately ⁸⁄₃, or 2⅔, for the given product; and,
in the same manner, ¹³⁄₂₄ multiphed by 6 gives ¹³⁄₄, or 3¼.

<span class="art">102</span> In general, therefore, the product of the multiplication of a fraction
$$\frac{a}{b}$$ by $$c$$ is $$\frac{ac}{b}$$;
and here it may be remarked, when the integer is exactly equal to the denominator,
that the product must be equal to the numerator.

So that

½ taken 2 times, gives 1;

⅔ taken three times, gives 1;

¾ taken four times, gives 1.

And, in general, if we multiply the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ by the
number $$b$$, the product must be $$a$$, as we have already shown;
for since $$\frac{a}{b}$$ expresses the quotient resulting from the division of the
dividend $$a$$ by the divisor $$b$$, and because it has
been demonstrated that the quotient multiplied by the divisor
will give the dividend, it is evident that $$\frac{a}{b}$$ multiplied by $$b$$
must produce $$a$$.

<span class="art">103</span> Having thus shown how a fraction is to be multiplied by an integer;
let us now consider also how a fraction
is to be divided by an integer. This inquiry is necessary,
before we proceed to the multiplication of fractions by fractions. It is evident,
if we have to divide the fraction ⅔ by
2, that the result must be ⅓; and that the quotient of ⁶⁄₇
divided by 3 is ²⁄₇. The rule therefore is, to divide the
numerator by the integer without changing the denominator.
Thus

¹²⁄₂₅ divided by 2 gives ⁶⁄₂₅;

¹²⁄₂₅ divided by 3 gives ⁴⁄₂₅;

¹²⁄₂₅ divided by 4 gives ³⁄₂₅; etc.

<span class="art">104</span> This rule may be easily practised, provided the
numerator be divisible by the number proposed; but very
often it is not: it must therefore be observed, that a fraction
may be transformed into an infinite number of other expressions,
and in that number there must be some, by which
the numerator might be divided by the given integer. If
it were required, for example, to divide ¾ by 2, we should
change the fraction into ⁶⁄₈, and then dividing the numerator
by 2, we should immediately have ⅜ for the quotient
sought.

In general, if it be proposed to divide the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$
by $$c$$, we change it into $$\frac{ac}{bc}$$, and then dividing the numerator
$$ac$$ by $$c$$, write $$\frac{a}{bc}$$ for the quotient sought.

<span class="art">105</span> When therefore a fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is to be divided by an
integer $$c$$, we have only to multiply the denominator by that
number, and leave the numerator as it is. Thus ⅝ divided
by 3 gives ⁵⁄₂₄, and ⁹⁄₁₆ divided by 5 gives ⁹⁄₈₀.

This operation becomes easier, when the numerator itself
is divisible by the integer, as we have supposed in <span class="artref">Art. 103</span>.
For example, ⁹⁄₁₆ divided by 3 would give, according
to our last rule, ⁹⁄₄₈; but by the first rule, which is applicable here,
we obtain ³⁄₁₆, an expression equivalent to ⁹⁄₄₈, but
more simple.

<span class="art">106</span> We shall now be able to understand how one fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$
may be multiplied by another fraction $$\frac{c}{d}$$. For this purpose,
we have only to consider that $$\frac{c}{d}$$ means that $$c$$ is divided by $$d$$;
and on this principle we shall first multiply the
fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ by $$c$$, which produces the result $$\frac{ac}{b}$$; after which
we shall divide by $$d$$, which gives $$\frac{ac}{bd}$$.

Hence the following rule for multiplying fractions. Multiply the numerators together for a numerator, and the denominators together for a denominator. Thus,

½ by ⅔ gives the product ²⁄₆, or ⅓;

⅔ by ⅘ gives ⁸⁄₁₅;

¾ by ⁵⁄₁₂ produces ¹⁵⁄₄₈, or ⁵⁄₁₆; etc.

<span class="art">107</span> It now remains to show how one fraction may be
divided by another. Here we remark first, that if the two
fractions have the same number for a denominator, the
division takes place only with respect to the numerators;
for it is evident, that ³⁄₁₂ are contained as many times in ⁹⁄₁₂
as 3 is contained in 9, that is to say, three times; and, in
the same manner, in order to divide ⁸⁄₁₂ by ⁹⁄₁₂, we have only
to divide 8 by 9, which gives ⁸⁄₉. We shall also have ⁶⁄₂₀
in ¹⁸⁄₂₀, 3 times; ⁷⁄₁₀₀ in ⁴⁹⁄₁₀₀, 7 times; ⁷⁄₂₅ in ⁶⁄₂₅, ⁶⁄₇ times; etc.

<span class="art">108</span> But when the fractions have not equal denominators,
we must have recourse to the method already mentioned for
reducing them to a common denominator. Let there be,
for example, the fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ to be divided by the fraction
$$\frac{c}{d}$$. We first reduce them to the same denominator, and
there results $$\frac{ad}{bd}$$ to be divided by $$\frac{cb}{bd}$$; it is now evident
that the quotient must be represented simply by the division
of $$ad$$ by $$bc$$; which gives $$\frac{ad}{bc}$$.

Hence the following rule: Multiply the numerator of the
dividend by the denominator of the divisor, and the denominator of
the dividend by the numerator of the divisor;
then the first product will be the numerator of the quotient,
and the second will be its denominator.

<span class="art">109</span> Applying this rule to the division of
⅝ by ⅔, we shall have the quotient ¹⁵⁄₁₆;
also the division of ¾ by ½ will give ⁶⁄₄, or ³⁄₂, or 1½;
and ²⁵⁄₄₈ by ⅚ will give ¹⁵⁰⁄₂₄₀, or ⅝.

<span class="art">110</span> This rule for division is often expressed in a manner
that is more easily remembered, as follows: Invert the
terms of the divisor, so that the denominator may be in the
place of the numerator, and the latter be written under the
line; then multiply the fraction, which is the dividend by
this inverted fraction, and the product will be the quotient sought.
Thus, ¾ divided by ½ is the same as ¾ multiplied by ²⁄₁, which makes ⁶⁄₄,
or 1½. Also ⅝ divided by ⅔ is
the same as ⅝ multiplied by ³⁄₂, which is ¹⁵⁄₁₆;
or ²⁵⁄₄₈ divided by ⅚ gives the same as ²⁵⁄₄₈ multiplied by ⁶⁄₅, the product of
which is ¹⁵⁰⁄₂₄₀, or ⅝.

We see then, in general, that to divide by the fraction ½ is
the same as to multiply by ²⁄₁, or 2; and that dividing by ⅓
amounts to multiplying by ³⁄₁, or by 3, etc.

<span class="art">111</span>  The number 100 divided by ½ will give 200; and
1000 divided by ⅓ will give 3000. Farther, if it were required to divide 1 by
¹⁄₁₀₀₀, the quotient would be 1000;
and dividing 1 by ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀, the quotient is 100000. This
enables us to conceive that, when any number is divided by
0, the result must be a number indefinitely great; for even
the division of 1 by the small fraction ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀₀₀ gives for
the quotient the very great number 1000000000.

<span class="art">112</span> Every number, when divided by itself, producing
unity, it is evident that a fraction divided by itself must also
give 1 for the quotient; and the same follows from our rule:
for, in order to divide ¾ by ¾, we must multiply ¾ by ⁴⁄₃, in
which case we obtain ¹²⁄₁₂, or 1; and if it be required to
divide $$\frac{a}{b}$$ by $$\frac{a}{b}$$, we multiply $$\frac{a}{b}$$
by $$\frac{b}{a}$$;
where the product $$\frac{ab}{ab}$$ is also equal to 1.

<span class="art">113</span> We have still to explain an expression which is
frequently used. It may be asked, for example, what is the
half of ¾? This means, that we must multiply ¾ by ½. So
likewise, if the value of ⅔ of ⅝ were required, we should
multiply ⅝ by ⅔, which produces ¹⁰⁄₂₄; and ¾ of ⁹⁄₁₆ is the
same as ⁹⁄₁₆ multiplied by ¾, which produces ²⁷⁄₆₄.

<span class="art">114</span> Lastly, we must here observe, with respect to the
signs + and -, the same rules that we before laid down for
integers. Thus +½ multiplied by -⅓, makes -⅙; and
-⅔ multiplied by -⅘, gives +⁸⁄₁₅. Farther -⅝ divided
by ⅔, gives -¹⁵⁄₁₆; and -¾ divided by -¾, gives +¹²⁄₁₂,
or +1.
