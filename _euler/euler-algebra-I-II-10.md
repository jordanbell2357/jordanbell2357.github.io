<span class="art">340</span> After squares and cubes, we must consider higher
powers, or powers of a greater number of degrees; which
are generally represented by exponents in the manner which
we before explained: we have only to remember, when the
root is compound, to enclose it in a parentheses: thus,
$$(a + b)^5$$ means that $$a + b$$ is raised to the fifth power, and
$$(a - b)^6$$ represents the sixth power of $$a - b$$, and so on.
We shall in this chapter explain the nature of these powers.

<span class="art">341</span> Let $$a + b$$ be the root, or the first power, and the
higher powers will be found, by multiplication, in the following manner:

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
(a+b)^1=&a&+b&\\
&a&+b&\\
\hline
&a^2&+ab&\\
&&+ab&+b^2\\
\hline
(a+b)^2=&a^2&+2ab&+b^2
\end{array}
$$

&a^3&+2a^2b&+ab^2&\\
&&+a^2b&+2ab^2&+b^3\\
\hline
(a+b)^3=&a^3&+3a^2b&+3ab^2&+b^3
\end{array}
$$

$$

$$

\end{array}
$$

etc.

<span class="art">342</span> The powers of the root $$a - b$$ are found in the same
manner; and we shall immediately perceive that they do
not differ from the preceding, excepting that the 2nd, 4th,
6th, etc. terms are affected by the sign minus.

$$
\begin{array}{rrrr}
(a-b)^1=&a&-b&\\
&a&-b&\\

$$

(a-b)^5=&a^5&-5a^4b&+10a^3b^2&-10a^2b^3&+5ab^4&-b^5
\end{array}
$$

$$

\end{array}
$$

etc.

Here we see that all the odd powers of b have the sign
-, while the even powers retain the sign +. The reason
of this is evident; for since $$-b$$ is a term of the root, the
powers of tliat letter will ascend in the following series, $$-b$$,
$$+b^2$$, $$-b^3$$, $$+b^4$$, $$-b^5$$, $$+b^6$$, etc. which clearly
shows that the even powers must be affected by the sign +, and the
odd ones by the contrary sign -.

<span class="art">343</span> An important question occurs in this place ; namely,
how we may find, without being obliged to perform the same
calculation, all the powers either of $$a+b$$ or $$a-b$$.

We must remark, in the first place, that if we can assign
all the powers of $$a + b$$, those of $$a - b$$ are also found;
since we have only to change the signs of the even terms,
that is to say, of the second, the fourth, the sixth, etc.. The
business then is to establish a rule, by which any power of
$$a+b$$, however high, may be determined without the necessity
of calculating all the preceding powers.

<span class="art">344</span> Now, if from the powers which we have already determined
we take away the numbers that precede each term,
which are called the *coefficients*, we observe in all the terms
a singular order: first, we see the first term $$a$$ of the root
raised to the power which is required; in the following
terms, the powers of $$a$$ diminish continually by unity, and
the powers of $$b$$ increase in the same proportion; so that the
sum of the exponents of $$a$$ and of $$b$$ is always the same, and
always equal to the exponent of the power required; and,
lastly, we find the term $$b$$ by itself raised to the same power.
If therefore the tenth power of $$a + b$$ were required, we are
certain that the terms, without their coefficients, would succeed each other in the following order;

$$a^{10}, a^9 b, a^8b^2, a^7b^3, a^6b^4, a^5b^5, a^4b^6, a^3b^7, a^2b^8, ab^9, b^{10}.$$

<span class="art">345</span> It remains therefore to shew how we are to determine the coefficients,
which belong to those terms, or the
numbers by which they are to be multiplied. Now, with
respect to the first term, its coefficient is always unity; and,
as to the second, its coefficient is constantly the exponent of
the power. With regard to the other terms, it is not so
easy to observe any order in their coefficients; but, if we
continue those coefficients, we shall not fail to discover the
law by which they are formed; as will appear from the
following Table.

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/qlwaqoyn">
<img src="/EulerAlgebra/qlwaqoyn.png" alt="Binomial coefficients for 1st power to 10th power" width="700" height="252">
</a>

We see then that the tenth power of $$a+b$$ will be

$$a^{10}+10a^9b+45a^8b^2+120a^7b^3+210a^6b^4+252a^5b^5+210a^4b^6+120a^3b^7+
45a^2b^8+10ab^9+b^{10}.$$

<span class="art">346</span> Now, with regard to the coefficients, it must be observed, that
for each power their sum must be equal to the
number 2 raised to the same power; for let $$a = 1$$ and
$$b = 1$$, then each term, without the coefficients, will be 1; consequently,
the value of the power will be simply the sum of
the coefficients. This sum, in the preceding example, is 1024,
and accordingly $$(1+1)^{10}=2^{10}=1024$$. It is the same
with respect to all other powers; thus, we have for the

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\textrm{1st}&1+1=2=2^1,\\
\textrm{2nd}&1+2+1=4=2^2,\\
\textrm{3rd}&=1+3+3+1=8=2^3,\\
\textrm{4th}&=1+4+6+4+1=16=2^4,\\
\textrm{5th}&=1+5+10+10+5+1=32=2^5,\\
\textrm{6th}&=1+6+15+20+15+6+1=64=2^6,\\
\textrm{7th}&=1+7+21+35+35+21+7+1=128=2^7,\\
&\textrm{etc.}
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">347</span> Another necessary remark, with regard to the coefficients, is,
that they increase from the beginning to the middle, and then decrease
in the same order. In the even powers, the greatest coefficient is
exactly in the middle; but in the odd powers, two coefficients, equal
and greater than the others, are found in the middle, belonging to the
mean terms.

The order of the coefficients likewise deserves particular
attention; for it is in this order that we discover the means
of determining them for any power whatever, without calculating
all the preceding powers. We shall here explain this method,
reserving the demonstration however for the next chapter.

<span class="art">348</span> In order to find the coefficients of any power proposed, the seventh for example, let us write the following
fractions one after the other:

$$
\frac{7}{1},\frac{6}{2},\frac{5}{3},\frac{4}{4},\frac{3}{5},\frac{2}{6},\frac{1}{7}.
$$

In this arrangement, we perceive that the numerators begin
by the exponent of the power required, and that they
diminish successively by unity; while the denominators
follow in the natural order of the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
Now, the first coefficient being always 1, the first fraction
gives the second coefficient; the product of the first two
fractions, multiplied together, represents the third coefficient;
the product of the three first fractions represents the fourth
coefficient, and so on. Thus, the

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{1st coefficient}&1&=1\\
\textrm{2nd coefficient}&\dfrac{7}{1}&=7\\
\textrm{3rd coefficient}&\dfrac{7 \cdot 6}{1\cdot 2}&=21\\
\textrm{4th coefficient}&\dfrac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{1\cdot 2 \cdot 3}&=35\\
\textrm{5th coefficient}&\dfrac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}&=35\\
\textrm{6th coefficient}&\dfrac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}&=21\\
\textrm{7th coefficient}&\dfrac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}{1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6}&=7\\
\textrm{8th coefficient}&\dfrac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7}&=1.
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">349</span> So that we have, for the second power, the fractions
$$\frac{2}{1},\frac{1}{2}$$; whence the first coefficient is 1,
the second $$\frac{2}{1}=2$$, and
the third $$2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}=1$$.

The third power furnishes the fractions $$\frac{3}{1},\frac{2}{2},\frac{1}{3}$$;
wherefore the

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{1st coefficient}&&=1;\\
\textrm{2nd coefficient}&\dfrac{3}{1}&=3;\\
\textrm{3rd coefficient}&3 \cdot \dfrac{2}{2}&=3;\\
\textrm{4th coefficient}&\dfrac{3}{1} \cdot \dfrac{2}{2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{3}&=1.\\
\end{array}
$$

We have, for the fourth power, the fractions
$$\frac{4}{1},\frac{3}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{4}$$,
consequently, the

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{1st coefficient}&&=1;\\
\textrm{2nd coefficient}&\dfrac{4}{1}&=4;\\
\textrm{3rd coefficient}&\dfrac{4}{1} \cdot \dfrac{3}{2}&=6;\\
\textrm{4th coefficient}&\dfrac{4}{1} \cdot \dfrac{3}{2} \cdot \dfrac{2}{3}&=4;\\
\textrm{5th coefficient}&\dfrac{4}{1} \cdot \dfrac{3}{2} \cdot \dfrac{2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{1}{4}&=1.
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">350</span> This rule evidently renders it unnecessary to find
the coefficients of the preceding powers, as it enables us to
discover immediately the coefficients which belong to any
one proposed. Thus, for the tenth power, we write the
fractions

$$\frac{10}{1},\frac{9}{2},\frac{8}{3},\frac{7}{4},\frac{6}{5},\frac{5}{6},\frac{4}{7},\frac{3}{8},\frac{2}{9},\frac{1}{10},$$

by means of which we find the

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{1st coefficient}&&=1;\\
\textrm{2nd coefficient}&\dfrac{10}{1}&=10;\\
\textrm{3rd coefficient}&10 \cdot \dfrac{9}{2}&=45;\\
\textrm{4th coefficient}&45 \cdot \dfrac{8}{3}&=120;\\
\textrm{5th coefficient}&120 \cdot \dfrac{7}{4}&=210;\\
\textrm{6th coefficient}&210 \cdot \dfrac{6}{5}&=252;\\
\textrm{7th coefficient}&252 \cdot \dfrac{5}{6}&=210;\\
\textrm{8th coefficient}&210 \cdot \dfrac{4}{7}&=120;\\
\textrm{9th coefficient}&120 \cdot \dfrac{3}{8}&=45;\\
\textrm{10th coefficient}&45 \cdot \dfrac{2}{9}&=10;\\
\textrm{11th coefficient}&10 \cdot \dfrac{1}{10}&=1.
\end{array}
$$

<span class="art">351</span> We may also write these fractions as they are,
without computing their value; and in this manner it is
easy to express any power of $$a+b$$. Thus,

$$
(a+b)^{100}=a^{100}+\frac{100}{1}a^{99}b+\frac{100\cdot 99}{1\cdot 2}a^{98}b^2
+\frac{100\cdot 99\cdot 98}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3}a^{97}b^3
+\frac{100\cdot 99\cdot 98 \cdot 97}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3 \cdot 4}a^{96}b^4
+\textrm{etc.}
$$

Whence the law of the succeeding terms may be easily deduced.
