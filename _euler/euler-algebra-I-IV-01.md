<span class="art">563</span> The principal object of Algebra, as well as of all
the other branches of Mathematics, is to determine the
value of quantities that were before unknown; and this is
obtained by considering attentively the conditions given,
which are always expressed in known numbers. For this
reason, Algebra has been defined, The science which
teaches how to determine unknown quantities by means of
those that are known.

<span class="art">564</span> The  above  definition  agrees  with all  that  has  been hitherto  laid  down: for  we  have  always  seen  that  the  knowledge of
certain  quantities  leads  to  that  of  other  quantities, which  before  might  have  been  considered  as  unknown.

Of this, Addition will readily furnish an example; for, in order to  find  the  sum  of  two  or
more given  numbers, we  had to  seek  for  an  unknown  number,  which  should  be  equal  to
those  known numbers taken  together.  In  Subtraction, we sought for a number which should be
equal to  the difference of two known numbers. A  multitude  of other examples are
presented by Multiplication, Division, the Involution of powers, and  the  Extraction  of  roots;
the  question being  always  reduced  to  finding,  by  means  of  known quantities,
other  quantities  which  are  unknown.

<span class="art">565</span> In the last section, also, different questions were
resolved, in which it was required to determine a number
that could not be deduced from the knowledge of other
given numbers, except under certain conditions. All
those questions were reduced to finding, by the aid of
some given numbers, a new number, which should have
a certain connection with them; and this connection was
determined by certain conditions, or properties, which
were to agree with the quantity sought

<span class="art">566</span> In Algebra, when we have a question to resolve,
we represent the number sought by one of the last letters
of the alphabet, and then consider in what manner the
given conditions can form an equality between two
quantities. This equality is represented by a kind of
formula, called an equation, which enables us finally to
determine the value of the number sought, and consequently to resolve the question. Sometimes several
numbers are sought; but they are found in the same
manner by equations.

<span class="art">567</span> Let us endeavour to explain this farther by an
example. Suppose the following question, or problem,
was proposed:

Twenty persons, men and women, dine at a tavern; the
share of the reckoning for one man is 8 shillings, for one
woman 7 shillings, and the whole reckoning amounts to
7*l.* 5*s.* Required the number of men and women
separately?[^1]

[^1]: 1 pound (*l.*) = 20 shillings (*s.*).

In order to resolve this question, let us suppose that the
number of men is $$=x$$; and, considering this number as
known, we shall proceed in the same manner as if we
wished to try whether it corresponded with the conditions
of the question. Now, the number of men being $$=x$$,
and the men and women making together twenty persons,
it is easy to determine the number of the women, having
only to subtract that of the men from 20, that is to say,
the number of women must be $$20-x$$.

But each man spends 8 shillings; therefore $$x$$ number
of men must spend $$8x$$ shillings. And since each woman
spends 7 shillings, $$20-x$$ women must spend $$140-7x$$
shillings. So that adding together $$8x$$ and $$140-7x$$, we see
that the whole 20 persons must spend $$140 +x$$ shillings.
Now, we know already how much they have spent;
namely, 7*l.* 5*s.* or 145*s.*; there must be an equality, therefore, between $$140+x$$ and 145;
that is to say, we have
the equation $$140 +x= 145$$, and thence we easily deduce
$$x=5$$, and consequently $$20-x=20-5=15$$; so that the
company consisted of 5 men and 15 women.

<span class="art">568</span> Again, Suppose twenty persons, men and women,
go to a tavern; the men spend 24 shillings, and the women
as much: but it is found that the men have spent 1 shilling each more than the women.
Required the number of men and women separately?

Let the number of men be represented by $$x$$. Then the women will be $$20-x$$.

Now, the $$x$$ men having spent 24 shillings, the share of
each man is $$\dfrac{24}{x}$$. The $$20-x$$ women having also spent 24
shillings, the share of each woman is $$\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$.

But we know that the share of each woman is one shilling
less than that of each man; if, therefore, we subtract 1 from
the share of a man, we must obtain that of a woman; and
consequently $$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$. This, therefore, is the
equation, from which we are to deduce the value of $$x$$. This
value is not found with the same ease as in the preceding
question; but we shall afterwards see that $$x=8$$, which
value answers to the equation; for $$\dfrac{24}{8}-1$$, or $$\dfrac{16}{8}=\dfrac{24}{12}$$
includes the equality $$2=2$$.

<span class="art">569</span> It is evident, therefore, how essential it is, in all
problems, to consider the circumstances of the question attentively, in order to deduce from it
an equation that shall express by letters the numbers sought, or unknown. After
that, the whole art consists in resolving those equations,
or deriving from them the values of the unknown numbers; and this shall be the subject of the
present section. 

<span class="art">570</span> We must remark, in the first place, the diversity
which subsists among the questions themselves. In some,
we seek only for one unknown quantity; in others, we
have to find two, or more; and, it is to be observed, with
regard to this last case, that, in order to determine them
all, we must deduce from the circumstances, or the conditions of the problem, as many equations
as there are unknown quantities.

<span class="art">571</span> It must have already been perceived, that an equation consists of two parts separated
by the sign of equality, $$=$$, to show that those two quantities are equal to one another; and
we are often obliged to perform a great number of transformations on those two parts, in order
to deduce from them the value of the unknown quantity: but these
transformations must be all founded on the following principles; namely, That two equal quantities
remain equal, whether we add to them, or subtract from them, equal
quantities; whether we multiply them, or divide them, by
the same number; whether we raise them both to the same
power, or extract their roots of the same degree; or lastly, 
whether we take the logarithms of those quantities, as we
have already done in the preceding section.

<span class="art">572</span> The  equations which are most easily resolved, are those
in  which  the  unknown quantity does not  exceed the first  power, after the terms of the
equation  have  been properly arranged; and these  are  called  simple  equations,
or equations  of  the  first  degree. But if,  after  having  reduced an  equation,
we  find  in it  the  square,  or the second  power, of the unknown  quantity,  it  is
called  an  equation  of  the second degree,  which  is  more difficult  to  resolve.
Equations of  the  third  degree  are  those  which  contain  the  cube  of the unknown
quantity,  and  so  on.  We  shall  treat  of  all  these in  the  present  section.

#### Solution of $$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$

Given

$$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$,

multiply each part by $$(20-x)$$:

$$\dfrac{24(20-x)}{x} - (20-x) = 24$$,

then multiply each part by $$x$$:

$$
24(20-x)-(20-x)x=24x,
$$

then distribute:

$$
480-24x-20x+20x^2=24x,
$$

then collect terms of the same degree:

$$
x^2-68x+480=0.
$$ 

$$a=1, b=-68, c=480$$

Suppose

$$mn=ac, \qquad m+n=b$$,

that is,

$$mn=480,\qquad m+n=-68$$.

The factors of 480 are

$$
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 80, 96, 120, 160, 240, 480
$$

Eventually we find

$$m=-8, n=-60$$.

Then

$$
x^2-8x-60x+480=0,
$$

and as $$x^2-8x=x(x-8)$$ and $$-60x+480=-60(x-8)$$,

$$
x(x-8)-60(x-8)=0,
$$

so

$$
(x-60)(x-8)=0.
$$

Therefore $$x=60$$ or $$x=8$$.

Because the total number of persons is 20, $$x=8$$.
