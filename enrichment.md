My work with primary mathematics has been working with gifted students doing enrichment - logic puzzles, geometry, problems from elementary school math contests. I have had successful online sessions with students as early as grade 3.

I am extraordinarily patient and somewhat good at giving young students the time they need because they are very much learning to focus - moving through topics giving them some short time to have their attention on distractions before moving them along.

I have no special childhood education training and for certain patterns of behavior like needing calming in order to focus, their are better places to go than me. On the other hand, I have worked very successfully with several students diagnosed with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, and because I take each student as they come to me, I find what works with each student and being told a diagnosis is not particularly important for one on one teaching. For some students, there is a particular difficulty moving concentration back and forth from screen to paper and here I have everything printed for both of us - it is not my domain to classify this problem in any way, only to identify students I see it in and change practices to address it as it occurs in our math work.
