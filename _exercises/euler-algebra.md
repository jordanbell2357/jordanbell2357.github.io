Section IV, Chapter I

> 563\. The principal object of Algebra, as well as of all
> the other branches of Mathematics, is to determine the
> value of quantities that were before unknown; and this is
> obtained by consideJ'ing attentively the conditions given,
> which are always expressed in known numbers. For this
> reason, Algebra has been defined, *The science which
> teaches how to determine unknown quantities by means of
> those that are known.*
>
> 564\. The  above  definition  agrees  with all  that  has  been hitherto  laid  down: for  we  have  always  seen  that  the  know- ledge of  certain  quantities  leads  to  that  of  other  quantities, which  before  might  have  been  considered  as  unknown.
>
> Of this, Addition  will  readily  furnish  an  example;  for,  in order  to  find  the  sum  of  two  or  more  given  numbers,  we  had to  seek  for  an  unknown  number,  which  should  be  equal  to those  known  numbers  taken  together.  In  Subtraction, we sought for a number which should be equal  to  the  difference of  two  known  numbers.  A  multitude  of  other  examples are  presented  by  Multiplication,  Division,  the  Involution of  powers,  and  the  Extraction  of  roots;  the  question being  always  reduced  to  finding,  by  means  of  known quantities,  other  quantities  which  are  unknown.
>
> 565\. ...
>
> 566\. In Algebra, when we have a question to resolve,
> we represent the number sought by one of the last letters
> of the alphabet, and then consider in what manner the
> given conditions can form an equality between two
> quantities. This equality is represented by a kind of
> formula, called an *equation*, which enables us finally to
> determine the value of the number sought, and consequently to resolve the question. Sometimes several
> numbers are sought; but they are found in the same
> manner by *equations*.
>
> 567\. Let us endeavour to explain this farther by an
> example. Suppose the following question, or *problem*,
> was proposed:
>
> Twenty persons, men and women, dine at a tavern; the
> share of the reckoning for one man is 8 shillings, for one
> woman 7 shillings, and the whole reckoning amounts to
> 7*l.* 5*s.*[^3] Required the number of men and women
> separately?
>
> In order to resolve this question, let us suppose that the
> number of men is $$=x$$; and, considering this number as
> known, we shall proceed in the same manner as if we
> wished to try whether it corresponded with the conditions
> of the question. Now, the number of men being $$=x$$,
> and the men and women making together twenty persons,
> it is easy to determine the number of the women, having
> only to subtract that of the men from 20, that is to say,
> the number of women must be $$20-x$$.
>
> But each man spends 8 shillings; therefore $x$ number
> of men must spend $$8x$$ shillings. And since each woman
> spends 7 shillings, $$20-x$$ women must spend $$140-7x$$
> shillings. So that adding together $$8x$$ and $$140-7x$$, we see
> that the whole 20 persons must spend $$140 +x$$ shillings.
> Now, we know already how much they have spent;
> namely, 7*l.* 5*s.* or 145*s.*;[^3] there must be an equality, therefore, between $$140+x$$ and 145; that is to say, we have
> the equation $$140 +x= 145$$, and thence we easily deduce
> $$x=5$$, and consequently $$20-x=20-5=15$$; so that the
> company consisted of 5 men and 15 women.
>
> 568\. Again, Suppose twenty persons, men and women,
go to a tavern; the men spend 24 shillings, and the women
as much: but it is found that the men have spent 1 shilling each more than the women. Required the number
of men and women separately?
>
> Let the number of men be represented by $$x$$.
>
> Then the women will be $$20-x$$.
>
> Now, the $$x$$ men having spent 24 shillings, the share of
> each man is $$\dfrac{24}{x}$$. The $$20-x$$ women having also spent 24
> shillings, the share of each woman is $$\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$.
>
> But we know that the share of each woman is one shilling
> less than that of each man; if, therefore, we subtract 1 from
> the share of a man, we must obtain that of a woman; and
> consequently $$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$. This, therefore, is the
> equation, from which we are to deduce the value of $$x$$. This
> value is not found with the same ease as in the preceding
> question; but we shall afterwards see that $$x=8$$, which
> value answers to the equation; for $$\dfrac{24}{8}-1$$, or $$\dfrac{16}{8}=\dfrac{24}{12}$$ includes the equality $$2=2$$.
>
> 569\. It is evident, therefore, how essential it is, in all
> problems, to consider the circumstances of the question attentively, in order to deduce from it an equation that shall
> express by letters the numbers sought, or unknown. After
> that, the whole art consists in resolving those equations,
> or deriving from them the values of the unknown numbers; and this shall be the subject of the present section. 
>
> 570\. We must remark, in the first place, the diversity
> which subsists among the questions themselves. In some,
> we seek only for one unknown quantity; in others, we
> have to find two, or more; and, it is to be observed, with
> regard to this last caEle, that, in order to determine them
> all, we must deduce from the circumstances, or the conditions of the problem, as many equations as there are
> unknown quantities.
>
> 571\. It must have already been perceived, that an equation consists of two parts separated by the sign of equality,
> $$=$$, to shew that those two quantities are equal to one another; and we are often obliged to perform a great number
> of transformations on those two parts, in order to deduce
> from them the value of the unknown quantity: but these
> transformations must be all founded on the following principles; namely, That two equal quantities remain equal,
> whether we add to them, or subtract from them, equal
> quantities; whether we multiply them, or divide them, by
> the same number; whether we raise them both to the same
> power, or extract their roots of the same degree; or lastly, 
> whether we take the logarithms of those quantities, as we
> have already done in the preceding section.
>
> 572\. The  equations  which  are  most  easily  resolved,  are those  in  which  the  unknown  quantity  does  not  exceed  the first  power,  after  the  terms  of  the  equation  have  been  properly arranged ;  and  these  are  called  *simple  equations*,  or *equations  of  the  first  degree*.  But  if,  after  having  reduced an  equation,  we  find  in it  the  square,  or  the  second  power, of  the  unknown  quantity,  it  is  called  an  *equation  of  the second  degree*,  which  is  more  difficult  to  resolve.  *Equations of  the  third  degree*  are  those  which  contain  the  cube  of  the unknown  quantity,  and  so  on.  We  shall  treat  of  all  these in  the  present  section.

> 625.  We  have  already  seen,  how  two  or  more  terms  of the  same  kind  may  be  united  together,  and  considered  as  a single  term.
For  example,  we  may  consider  the  formula ax^  —  bx"^  +  cx^'  as  a  single  term,  representing  it  thus, {a  —  b  -\-  c)x^ ;  since,  in   fact,   {a  —  b  +  c)  is  a  known quantity.
And  also,  when  such  terms  are  found  on  both  sides  of  the eign  = ,  we  have  seen  how  they  may  be  brought  to  one  side.
>
> and  then  reduced  to  a  single  term.     Let  us  take,  for  ex- ample, the  equation,
2x-  -  3x  +  4)  =  5x"  —8^+11 ;, we  first  subtract  Qx",  and  there  remains
.     -  3^  -i-  4  =  3x"  —  8:c  +  11 ;  ^
then  adding  Sx,  we  obtain,
5x  +  4!  =  Sx^  +  11 ; lastly,  subtracting  11,  there  remains  3^^  =  5x  —  7-
626.  We  may  also  bring  all  the  terms  to  one  side  of  the sign  = ,  so  as  to  leave  zero,  or  0,  on  the  other ;  but  it  must be  remembered,  that  when  terms  are  transposed  from  one side  to  the  other,  their  signs  must  be  changed.
Thus,  the  above  equation  will  assume  this  form,  Sx^  — 5^  -f  7  =  0 ;  and,  for  this  reason  also,  the  following  general formula  represents  all  equations  of  the  second  degree ;
ax°'  ±bx  ±  c  =  0; in  which  the  sign  +  is  read  plus  or  minus,  and  indicates, that   such    terms   as   it   stands  before   may   be   sometimes positive,  and  sometimes  negative.

[^3]: 1 pound (*l.*) = 20 shillings (*s.*); thus 7l. 5s. = 145s.

Chapter IX

> 689.  What  we  have  already  said  sufficiently  shews,  that equations  of  the  second  degree  admit  of  two  solutions ;  and this  property  ought  to  he  examined  in  every  point  of  view, because  the  nature  of  equations  of  a  higher  degree  will  be very  much  illustrated  by  such  an  examination.  We  shall therefore  retrace,  with  more  attention,  the  reasons  which render  an  equation  of  the  second  degree  capable  of  a  double solution;  since  they  undoubtedly  will  exhibit  an  essential property  of  those  equations.
690.  We  have  already  seen,  indeed,  that  this  double  solu- tion arises  from  the  circumstance  that  the  square  root  of  any number  may  be  taken  either  positively,  or  negatively  ;  but, as  this  principle  will  not  easily  apply  to  equations  of  higher degrees,  it  may  be  proper  to  illustrate  it  by  a  distinct analysis.  Taking,  therefore,  for  an  example,  the  quadratic equation,  x'^  =  12.r  —  ^5,  we  shall  give  a  new  reason  for this  equation  being  resolvible  in  two  ways,  by  admitting  for X  the  values  5  and  7,  both  of  which  will  satisfy  the  terms  of the  equation,
691.  For  this  purpose  it  is  most  convenient  to  begin  with transposing  the  terms  of  the  equation,  so  that  one  of  the sides  may  become  0  ;  the  above  equation  consequently  takes the  form
X'  -\2x  -{-^5  =  0; and  it  is  now  required   to  find  a  number  such,  that,  if  wc substitute  it  for  ^',  the  quantity  x'^  —  12^'  -(-  35  may  be  really equal  to  nothing;   after  which,  we  shall  have  to  shew  how this  may  be  done  in  two  different  ways.
>
> 692.  Now,  the  whole  of  this  consists  in  clearly  shewing, that  a  quantity  of  the  form  x-  —  12x  -j-  35  may  be  con- sidered as  the  product  of  two  factors.  Thus,  in  reality,  the quantity  of  which  we  spealc  is  composed  of  the  two  factors (x  —  5)  X  {x  —  7) :  and  since  the  above  quantity  must become  0,  wc  must  also  have  the  product  {x  —  5)  x  [x  —  7) —  0 ;  but  a  product,  of  whatever  number  of  factors  it  is composed,  becomes  equal  to  0,  only  when  one  of  those  fac- tors is  reduced  to  0.  This  is  a  fundamental  principle,  to which  we  must  pay  particular  attention,  especially  when equations  of  higher  degrees  are  treated  of.
>
> 693.  It  is  therefore  easily  understood,  that  ihe  product
>
> (jr  —  5)  X  ('*■  —  7)  may  become  0  in  two  ways :  first,  wlicn the  first  factor  x  —5  =  0;  and  also,  when  the  second  factor X  —  7  =  0.  In  the  first  case,  x  =■  5,  in  the  second  .r  =  7. The  reason  is  therefore  very  evident,  why  such  an  equation x"  —  12a.-  +  35  =  0,  admits  of  two  solutions  ;  that  is  to  say, why  we  can  assign  two  values  of  jt,  both  of  which  equally satisfy  the  terms  of  the  equation  ;  for  it  depends  upon  this fundiamental  principle,  that  the  quantity  .r^  —  l^o:  +  35 may  be  represented  by  the  product  of  two  factors.
694.  The  same  circumstances  are  found  in  all  equa- tions of  the  second  degree :  for,  after  having  brought  the terms  to  one  side,  we  find  an  equation  of  the  following- form  x"  —  a.v  -j-  6  =  0,  and  this  formula  may  be  always considered  as  the  product  of  two  factors,  which  we  shall  re- present by  {x  —  p)  y.  {x  —  q),  without  concerning  ourselves what  numbers  the  letters  p  and  q  represent,  or  whether  they be  negative  or  positive.  Now,  as  this  product  must  be  =  0, from  the  nature  of  our  equation,  it  is  evident  that  this  may happen  in  two  cases  ;  in  the  first  place,  when  x  =  p;  and  in the  second  place,  when  x  =i  q;  and  these  are  the  two  values of  X  which  satisfy  the  terms  of  the  equation.
695.  Let  us  here  consider  the  nature  of  these  two  factors, in  order  that  the  multiplication  of  the  one  by  the  other  may exactly  produce  x"  —  ax  +  b.  By  actually  multiplying them,  we  obtain  x-  —  {p  -\-  q)  x  -{-  pq  ;  which  quantity  must be  the  same  as  x'^  —  ax  -\-  b,  therefore  we  have  evidently p  -\-  q  =  a,  and  pq  =  b.  Hence  is  deduced  this  very  re- markable property;  that  in  ever}'^  equation  of  the  form x'^  —  ax  -{-  b  =  0,  the  two  values  of  x  are  such,  that  their sum  is  equal  to  a,  and  their  product  equal  to  b ;  it  there- fore necessarily  follows,  that,  if  we  know  one  of  the  values, the  other  also  is  easily  found.
>
> 696.  We  have  at  present  considered  the  case,  in  which  the two  values  of  x  are  positive,  and  which  requires  the  second term  of  the  equation  to  have  the  sign  — ,  and  the  third  term to  have  the  sign  -{-. '  Let  us  also  consider  the  cases,  in  which either  one  or  both  values  of  cZ-  become  negative.  The  first takes  place,  when  the  two  factors  of  the  equation  give  a  pro- duct of  this  form,  {x  —  p)  x  [x  +  q)  ;  for  then  the  two values  of  x  are  x  =  p,  and  x  =  —  q;  and  the  equation itself  becomes
a-'  -r  iq  —  J>)  '^'  —  T^g  =  0  ; the  second  term  having  the  sign  + ,  when  q  is  greater  than  />, and  the  sign  — ,  when  q  is  less  than  /; ;  lastly,  the  tliird  term 
>
> The  second  case,  in  which  both  values  of  x  are  negative, occurs,  when  the  two  factors  are
{x-\-'p)x  Cr  +  g); for  we  shall  then  have  x  ==  --  p,  and  x  ■=.  —  q;  the  equa- tion itself  therefore  becomes
i-  +  {p  ■{■  q)  X -{- pq  =  0, in  which  both  the  second  and  third  terms  are  affected  by  the sign  +.

Given


$$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$,

multiply each part by $(20-x)$,

$$\dfrac{24(20-x)}{x} - (20-x) = 24$$,

then multiply each part by $x$,

$$
24(20-x)-(20-x)x=24x,
$$

then distribute,

$$
480-24x-20x+20x^2=24x,
$$

then collect terms of the same degree,

$$
x^2-68x+480=0.
$$ 

$$a=1, b=-68, c=480$$

Suppose

$$mn=ac, \qquad m+n=b$$,

that is,

$$mn=480,\qquad m+n=-68$$.

$$m=-8, n=-60$$

$$
x^2-8x-60x+480=0
$$

$$
x(x-8)-60(x-8)=0
$$

$$
(x-60)(x-8)=0
$$

Therefore $x=60$ or $x=8$.

Because the total number of persons is 20, $$x=8$$.
