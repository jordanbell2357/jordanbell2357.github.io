Section IV, Chapter I

> 563\. The principal object of Algebra, as well as of all
> the other branches of Mathematics, is to determine the
> value of quantities that were before unknown; and this is
> obtained by consideJ'ing attentively the conditions given,
> which are always expressed in known numbers. For this
> reason, Algebra has been defined, *The science which
> teaches how to determine unknown quantities by means of
> those that are known.*
>
> 564\. The  above  definition  agrees  with all  that  has  been hitherto  laid  down: for  we  have  always  seen  that  the  know- ledge of  certain  quantities  leads  to  that  of  other  quantities, which  before  might  have  been  considered  as  unknown.
>
> Of this, Addition  will  readily  furnish  an  example;  for,  in order  to  find  the  sum  of  two  or  more  given  numbers,  we  had to  seek  for  an  unknown  number,  which  should  be  equal  to those  known  numbers  taken  together.  In  Subtraction, we sought for a number which should be equal  to  the  difference of  two  known  numbers.  A  multitude  of  other  examples are  presented  by  Multiplication,  Division,  the  Involution of  powers,  and  the  Extraction  of  roots;  the  question being  always  reduced  to  finding,  by  means  of  known quantities,  other  quantities  which  are  unknown.
>
> 565\. ...
>
> 566\. In Algebra, when we have a question to resolve,
> we represent the number sought by one of the last letters
> of the alphabet, and then consider in what manner the
> given conditions can form an equality between two
> quantities. This equality is represented by a kind of
> formula, called an *equation*, which enables us finally to
> determine the value of the number sought, and consequently to resolve the question. Sometimes several
> numbers are sought; but they are found in the same
> manner by *equations*.
>
> 567\. Let us endeavour to explain this farther by an
> example. Suppose the following question, or *problem*,
> was proposed:
>
> Twenty persons, men and women, dine at a tavern; the
> share of the reckoning for one man is 8 shillings, for one
> woman 7 shillings, and the whole reckoning amounts to
> 7*l.* 5*s.*[^3] Required the number of men and women
> separately?
>
> In order to resolve this question, let us suppose that the
> number of men is $$=x$$; and, considering this number as
> known, we shall proceed in the same manner as if we
> wished to try whether it corresponded with the conditions
> of the question. Now, the number of men being $$=x$$,
> and the men and women making together twenty persons,
> it is easy to determine the number of the women, having
> only to subtract that of the men from 20, that is to say,
> the number of women must be $$20-x$$.
>
> But each man spends 8 shillings; therefore $x$ number
> of men must spend $$8x$$ shillings. And since each woman
> spends 7 shillings, $$20-x$$ women must spend $$140-7x$$
> shillings. So that adding together $$8x$$ and $$140-7x$$, we see
> that the whole 20 persons must spend $$140 +x$$ shillings.
> Now, we know already how much they have spent;
> namely, 7*l.* 5*s.* or 145*s.*;[^3] there must be an equality, therefore, between $$140+x$$ and 145; that is to say, we have
> the equation $$140 +x= 145$$, and thence we easily deduce
> $$x=5$$, and consequently $$20-x=20-5=15$$; so that the
> company consisted of 5 men and 15 women.
>
> 568\. Again, Suppose twenty persons, men and women,
go to a tavern; the men spend 24 shillings, and the women
as much: but it is found that the men have spent 1 shilling each more than the women. Required the number
of men and women separately?
>
> Let the number of men be represented by $$x$$.
>
> Then the women will be $$20-x$$.
>
> Now, the $$x$$ men having spent 24 shillings, the share of
> each man is $$\dfrac{24}{x}$$. The $$20-x$$ women having also spent 24
> shillings, the share of each woman is $$\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$.
>
> But we know that the share of each woman is one shilling
> less than that of each man; if, therefore, we subtract 1 from
> the share of a man, we must obtain that of a woman; and
> consequently $$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$. This, therefore, is the
> equation, from which we are to deduce the value of $$x$$. This
> value is not found with the same ease as in the preceding
> question; but we shall afterwards see that $$x=8$$, which
> value answers to the equation; for $$\dfrac{24}{8}-1$$, or $$\dfrac{16}{8}=\dfrac{24}{12}$$ includes the equality $$2=2$$.
>
> 569\. It is evident, therefore, how essential it is, in all
> problems, to consider the circumstances of the question attentively, in order to deduce from it an equation that shall
> express by letters the numbers sought, or unknown. After
> that, the whole art consists in resolving those equations,
> or deriving from them the values of the unknown numbers; and this shall be the subject of the present section. 
>
> 570\. We must remark, in the first place, the diversity
> which subsists among the questions themselves. In some,
> we seek only for one unknown quantity; in others, we
> have to find two, or more; and, it is to be observed, with
> regard to this last caEle, that, in order to determine them
> all, we must deduce from the circumstances, or the conditions of the problem, as many equations as there are
> unknown quantities.
>
> 571\. It must have already been perceived, that an equation consists of two parts separated by the sign of equality,
> $$=$$, to shew that those two quantities are equal to one another; and we are often obliged to perform a great number
> of transformations on those two parts, in order to deduce
> from them the value of the unknown quantity: but these
> transformations must be all founded on the following principles; namely, That two equal quantities remain equal,
> whether we add to them, or subtract from them, equal
> quantities; whether we multiply them, or divide them, by
> the same number; whether we raise them both to the same
> power, or extract their roots of the same degree; or lastly, 
> whether we take the logarithms of those quantities, as we
> have already done in the preceding section.

[^3]: 1 pound (*l.*) = 20 shillings (*s.*); thus 7l. 5s. = 145s.


$$\dfrac{24}{x}-1=\dfrac{24}{20-x}$$

$$\dfrac{24(20-x)}{x} - (20-x) = 24$$

$$
24(20-x)-(20-x)x=24x
$$

$$
480-24x-(20x-x^2)=24x
$$

$$
480-24x-20x+x^2=24x
$$

$$
x^2-68x+480=0
$$

$$a=1, b=-68, c=480$$

$$ac = 480$$

$$m=-8, n=-60$$

$$mn = ac,  m+n=b$$

$$
x^2-8x-60x+480=0
$$

$$
x(x-8)-60(x-8)=0
$$

$$
(x-60)(x-8)=0
$$

Therefore $x=60$ or $x=8$, and because the total number of men and women is 20, $$x=8$$.
