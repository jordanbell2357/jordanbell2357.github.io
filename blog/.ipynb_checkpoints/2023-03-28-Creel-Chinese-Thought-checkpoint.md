pp. 8-9, Chapter I:

> To escape from the world becomes more and more difficult. Most
> of the Chinese have never tried to. Instead, they have looked for
> ways in which it is possible to dwell with other people without
> being irritated by them, and to live in the world without being
> oppressed by it. On the whole, they have been quite successful in
> this. It would be a mistake, of course, to expect that these Chinese
> solutions could be applied to our own situation without any
> modification; yet there is no question at all that we can learn a
> great deal from them. At the very least, they set our own problems
> in a new light and let us look at them more objectively.
> This is perhaps the greatest use that a knowledge of China can
> have for us. We are too close to ourselves; we cannot get outside
> our own skins and our own civilization. Do we do the things we do
> because they are the only sensible, the only "human" things to do?
> Or do we do them because centuries of social habit and the
> pressure of the circumstances under which we live compel us to act
> as we do? How can we tell?
>
> One way to get some light on this question is to see how other
> peoples, who have different social habits and live under different
> circumstances, have solved the same problems. That is one reason
> why the reports of anthropologists concerning so-called
> "primitive" societies make such fascinating reading. Yet for this
> purpose relatively simple societies have one great drawback. They
> are too different from our own; we feel, rightly or not, that our
> culture is on an entirely different level and cannot really be
> compared with them. Chinese civilization, on the other hand,
> while it is very different from our own, is in many ways quite
> comparable with it. Certainly ours is superior to it in some ways,
> but there is no doubt that in some other respects the advantage has
> rested with the Chinese for centuries, and possibly still does.
> Most important of all, China's civilization has grown up in
> dependently of our own. Among the several greatest cultures that
> humanity has produced, there is no other that has had, in its
> formative period, so few relationships of mutual influence with our
> own Western culture.* Thus we can view China as a great social
> laboratory, in which for three thousand years of recorded history
> men and women have been doing things with ideas and
> institutions that are often quite different from the things we do.
> This book proposes to take the reader on a brief visit to this
> laboratory, to see something of what has been going on and
> something of what it means. We shall consider in particular detail
> the thought of those periods in which Chinese civilization was
> most purely and simply Chinese. And, finally, we shall look at the
> ways in which Chinese thought has reacted to influences from
> India, from western Europe and America, and from Russia.

pp. 95-, Chapter VI:

> There is a much more full account, supposedly quoting the words
> of Yang Chu himself, that appears as a chapter of the Taoist work
> called *Lieh Tzŭ*. Unfortunately, the *Lieh Tzŭ* is a book that is now
> generally recognized to be a forgery, probably perpetrated many
> centuries later than the time of Yang Chu, who is believed to have
> lived in the fourth century B.C. There are a few scholars, however,
> who believe that, despite the fact that the book as a whole is a
> forgery, the portion on Yang Chu may include genuine materials
> which have survived from an earlier day; they point out that it
> contains the kind of things we should expect Yang to have said.
> This is a difficult point. These passages in the *Lieh Tzŭ* may be
> nothing more than early attempts to reconstruct the kind of
> statements that Yang Chu might have written, and the kind of
> sentiments from which the beginnings of Taoist thought originated. Whatever their
> origins, they are interesting. The *Lieh Tzŭ* tells us:
