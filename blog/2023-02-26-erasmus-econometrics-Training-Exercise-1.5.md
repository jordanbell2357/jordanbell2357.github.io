> In Lecture 1.5, we applied simple regression for data on winning times on the Olympic 100 meter (athletics). We
> computed the regression coefficients $$a$$ and $$b$$ for two trend models, one with a linear trend and one with a nonlinear
> trend. In a test question, you created forecasts of the winning times for both men and women in 2008 and 2012.
> Of course, you can also forecast further ahead in the future. In fact, it is even possible to predict when men and
> women would run equally fast, if the current trends persist.
>
> (a) Show that the linear trend model predicts equal winning times at around 2140.
>
> (b) Show that the nonlinear trend model predicts equal winning times at around 2192.
>
> (c) Show that the linear trend model predicts equal winning times of approximately 8.53 seconds.
>
> (d) Comment on these outcomes and on the underlying regression models
