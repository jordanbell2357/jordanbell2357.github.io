# Vessel Traffic Density from AIS Data (2013-2015)

[Vessel Traffic Density from AIS Data (2013-2015) \| CSIRO](https://marlin.csiro.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/e11903ab-836c-4b67-aa41-b2fcf7f70ed2)

> Maps of vessel density 2013-2015 for AIS-equipped vessels, in terms of km traversed in each cell for range of vessel classes for the Australian EZ.
> AIS data was sourced from AMSA and subsequently processed. The density was calculated for subsets of vessels based on various characteristics such as
> size or vessel use/purpose. These characteristics were derived and may contain errors. See Peel et. al. (2018) for detail on the processing methods. 
> References Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) – Custom data extraction of AIS data 2013-2015.
