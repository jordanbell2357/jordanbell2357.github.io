> *DESCRIPTION*  
> The *bc* utility shall implement an arbitrary precision calculator. It shall take input from any files given,
> then read from the standard input. If the standard input and standard output to *bc* are attached to a terminal,
> the invocation of *bc* shall be considered to be interactive, causing behavioral constraints described in
> the following sections.
>
> *OPTIONS*  
>
> The following option shall be supported:
>
> **-l**  
> (The letter ell.) Define the math functions and initialize *scale* to 20, instead of the default zero; see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

> Each expression or named expression has a *scale*, which is the number of decimal digits that shall be maintained as the fractional portion of the expression.
