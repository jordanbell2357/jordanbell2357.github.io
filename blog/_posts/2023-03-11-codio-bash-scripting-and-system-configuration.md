echo {0..100..5}
mkdir {png,jpg,pdf}_files{1..3}
touch {png,jpg,pdf}_files{1..3}/image_{1..5}
rm {png,jpg,pdf}_files{1..3}/image_{1..5}
rmdir {png,jpg,pdf}_files{1..3}
echo "6 times 3 is equal to: $(( 6 * 3 ))"

# Command Substitution

```bash
echo "Today is $(date)."
```

# `[]`

```bash

# Test

```bash
[ "green" = "green" ]; echo $?
```

<samp>0</samp>

```bash

<samp>0</samp>

```bash
[ 7 -gt 15 ]; echo $?

# Arrays

Implicit

```bash
instruments=("piano" "flute" "guitar" "oboe")
```

Explicit

```bash
declare -a instruments=("piano" "flute" "guitar" "oboe")
```

```bash
echo ${instruments[1]}
```

<samp>flute</samp>

```bash
echo ${instruments[@]}
```

```bash
for i in {0..6}; do echo "$i: ${instruments[$i]}"; done
```

# Associative Arrays

```bash
declare -A student
student[name]=Rodney
student["area of study"]="Systems Administration"
echo ${student[name]} is majoring in ${student["area of study"]}.
```

<samp>Rodney is majoring in Systems Administration.</samp>
