> AIS Vessel Tracks 2021

> A vessel track shows the location and characteristics of commercial, recreational, and other marine vessels as a sequence of positions transmitted by an Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS signals are susceptible to interference and this can result in a gap within a vessel track. Vessels can have one or more tracks of any length. Furthermore, tracks will not necessarily start or stop at a well defined port, or when a vessel is not in motion. The distribution, type, and frequency of vessel tracks are a useful aid to understanding the risk of conflicting uses within a certain geographic area and are an efficient and spatially unbiased indicator of vessel traffic. The vessel track positions in this data set are collected and recorded from land-based antennas as part of a national network operated by the U.S. Coast Guard. These tracks were used to build the respective AIS Vessel Transit Counts 2021 layer, in which a single transit is counted each time a vessel track passes through, starts, or stops within a grid cell.

> Vessels traveling in U.S. coastal and inland waters frequently use Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) for navigation safety. The U.S. Coast Guard collects AIS records using shore-side antennas. These records have been filtered and converted from a series of points to a set of track lines, and then summarized at a 100 m grid cell resolution. A single transit is counted each time a vessel track passes through, starts, or stops within a grid cell. All vessel types have been included in this summary, including null and none reported types.
