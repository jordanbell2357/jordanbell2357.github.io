This assignment will be graded by submitting two URLs. The first URL will be a link to the GitHub repository for this project, and the second URL will be the link to the GitHub Pages site for the project.

The GitHub repository should have only the following three files:

A Bash script called guessinggame.sh.

A makefile.

A markdown file called README.md.

The guessinggame.sh program should have the following behavior:

When the program starts the user should be asked how many files are in the current directory, and then the user should be prompted for a guess.

If the user's answer is incorrect the user should be advised that their guess was either too low or too high and then they should be prompted to try to guess again.

If the user's guess is correct then they should be congratulated and the program should end.

The program should not end until the user has entered the correct number of files in the current directory.

The program should be able to be run by entering bash guessinggame.sh into the console.

The program should contain at least one function, one loop, and one if statement.

The program should be more than 20 lines of code but less than 50 lines of code.

The makefile should produce the README.md which should contain the following information:

The title of the project.

The date and time at which make was run.

The number of lines of code contained in guessinggame.sh.

The README.md should be produced entirely from the makefile and should not be edited by hand.

The second URL should be the GitHub Pages site that is generated from the README.md file.

As long as you satisfy all of the criteria above with your program then you should receive full credit for this assignment.
