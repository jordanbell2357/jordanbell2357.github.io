title: Subset sum problem
---

Let $$S$$ be a set of integers and let $$k$$ be an integer. Define
$$P(S,k)$$ to be true if there is a subset $$T$$ of $$S$$ such that
$$\sum_{t \in T} = k$$ - that is, if $$T=\{t_1,\ldots,t_n\}$$, then
$$t_1+\cdots+t_n = k$$ -, and false if there is no subset $$T$$ of $$S$$ such
that $$\sum_{t \in T} = k$$.
