My work with primary mathematics has been working with gifted students doing enrichment - logic puzzles, geometry, problems from elementary school math contests. I have had successful online sessions with students as early as grade 3.

I have no special childhood education training and for certain patterns of behavior like needing calming in order to focus, their are better places to go than me. On the other hand, I have worked very successfully with several students diagnosed with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, and because I take each student as they come to me, I find what works with each student and being told a diagnosis is not particularly important for one on one teaching. For some students, there is a particular difficulty moving concentration back and forth from screen to paper and here I have everything printed for both of us - it is not my domain to classify this problem in any way, only to identify students I see it in and change practices to address it as it occurs in our math work.

My tutoring practice is done online in one hour sessions, scheduled with Google Calendar and using the client's preference of video chat. The one-on-one communication in tutoring avoid all the downfalls of online courses (disengagement, undirected, uncertain if you are doing it right), and adds new tools to use for one-on-one teaching. Most of math is done on paper, and my experience has shown that the simple method of holding paper up to the camera works perfectly.

I am an extraordinarily experienced tutor for mathematics courses and mathematical courses (physics, economics, and accounting), with a calling for education, learning, explanation and exposition.[^1] I intentionally try to tutor all levels of math from higher elementary up - and my goal is to alway find the student's level and to help them move forward from wherever that is, whether it is adding fractions, linear equations, multiplying polynomials, finding roots, determining asymptotes, taking a derivative, finding the basis for a vector space, doing Langrange multipliers, or working with Brownian motion and stochastic calculus. Knowledge is a ladder that goes up forever and what matters is the process of moving up rungs.
