<p>Shamash, seated before an altar, holds the saw; from his shoulders issue the usual sunrays. Before him stands a person holding in his raised left hand a pair of scales. This person is followed by another, who carries a goat as an offering. A smaller person behind the others holds a knife(?) over an altar(?), perhaps waiting to perform a sacrifice. At the end of the scene are two badly worn cuneiform signs.</p>
<p>To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the only representation of the balance with scalepans in Mesopotamian glyptic.</p>

<p>One of the oldest surviving images of an equal-arm balance. Egyptian tomb, VI Dynasty, after ca. 2300 BC. (OIP 31, plate 30, Copyright The Oriental Institute of The University of Chicago).</p>
<p>To the modern observer, this is no longer something to marvel at. The operation of the unequal-arm balance can be described by the law of the lever. Equilibrium is obtained when the arms of the lever are in inverse proportion to the weights that are applied to them. Should it therefore be assumed that insight into the law of the lever was what made it possible for such balances to be built? Research by Department I has shown that the opposite is more likely to be the case. The first mention of an unequal-arm balance is found in a comedy from the year 421 BCE by the Athenian playwright Aristophanes. The first known formulation of the law of the lever, however, dates to the next century. There is in fact much to suggest that it was the existence of unequal-arm balances–which so clearly embody the law of the lever–that first stimulated the formulation of the law.</p>

<p>A set of Hematite weights from Ur, southern Iraq, 1900-1600 BCE. Hematite was consistently used in Mesopotamia for weights from the late 3rd milennium BC; it is a hard stone which wears well and it would be obvious if it had been tampered with. A system of weights and measures was adopted, so that payments to workers could be reckoned, and also in order to calculate the value of precious objects. ANE 117891, ANE 117.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolving irrigation networks are likely to have been a powerful stimulus to innovation in related technology. As the necessary technical devices were made of organic materials and very rarely appear in art, their development is largely a matter of conjecture. Apart from the screw, which is a development of the Neo-Assyrian (?) period, it is known that the four basic technical devices for the redirection of muscular effort-the lever, the wedge, the windlass, and the pulley-were inherited by the Greek world from the East. In all likelihood the lever and the wedge had emerged there in remote prehistory; but it is possible that a particular application in irrigation popularized the lever. It is vital to the shadoof, an extremely versatile water-lifting device easily constructed from locally available timber. Although this machine is not illustrated until it appears on a cylinder seal in the third quarter of the third millennium BC, it is a device so necessary to irrigation in southern Mesopotamia that its invention has been assumed to be much older. The shadoof was generally made of a long wooden pole secured at a fulcrum to a horizontal beam of wood, supported at each end by a timber pole or by a mudbrick column. The short end of the lever was counterweighted with a stone or a lump of clay, with the bucket attached by a rope to the other end, The best surviving illustrations are on a relief of the reign of Sennacherib in the seventh century BC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking at the conditions of the ancient world, of a large number of communities each developing a strongly individual civilisation, the presumption is that there would be as many standards as there were languages. The vision of our reducing all to one original standard is as hopeless as the old idea of one primitive universal language.</p>
