<blockquote>
<p>But in literary history, as contrasted with archaeology, the forays of enthusiasts do not destroy the evidence. On the contrary, they may provide the stimulus to research by which their own errors can be corrected. And so iit has proved in this case. For it is now established that apart from the printed texts there exist scores of manuscript treatises on logic from the twelfth and later centuries. Until these have all been edited, or at least analysed and described, by experts in medieval studies, there can be no hope of determining correctly the various strata of the great deposit.</p>

<p>Plural predication in Plato, <span><em>Hippias Major</em></span> 300d–e <span class="citation" data-cites="hippias">(<a href="#ref-hippias" role="doc-biblioref">Waterfield 2005b, 259</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hippias: You’ll have finer knowledge than anyone whether or not I’m playing games, Socrates, when you try to describe these notions of yours and are shown to be talking nonsense. It’s quite impossible – you’ll never find an attribute which neither you nor I have, but which both of us have.</p>
<p>Socrates: Are you sure, Hippias? I suppose you’ve got a point, but <span><em>I</em></span> don’t understand. Let me explain more clearly what I’m getting at: it seems to me that both of us together may possess as an attribute something which neither I have as an attribute nor am (and neither are you); and, to put it the other way round, that neither of us, as individuals, may be something which both of us together have as an attribute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, Socrates ironically says the following, 301d–e <span class="citation" data-cites="hippias">(<a href="#ref-hippias" role="doc-biblioref">Waterfield 2005b, 260</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, before you spoke, my friend, we were so inane as to believe that <span><em>each</em></span> of us – you and I – is one, but that both of us together, being two not one, are not what each individual is. See how stupid we were! But now we know better: you’ve explained that if both together are two, then each individual must be two as well; and if each individual is one, both must be one as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hippias eventually agrees with the following statement of Socrates, 302b <span class="citation" data-cites="hippias">(<a href="#ref-hippias" role="doc-biblioref">Waterfield 2005b, 261</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>

Or do you think you can?” The point here is that without changing, the six dice are both more and fewer.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record how wittily Diogenes responded to a sophism of the kind that I mentioned above, when a dialectician from Plato’s school put it forward in the hope of making fun of him. For when the dialectician had asked, ‘That which I am, you are not?’ and Diogenes had assented, and he had then added, ‘Now I am a human being’, and Diogenes had assented to that too, he concluded: ‘So it follows that you are not a human being.’ ‘Now that’, replied Diogenes, ‘is false, but if you want it to become true, start off with me.’</p>

<p>A <span><em>substance</em></span> – that which is called a substance most strictly, primarily, and most of all – is that which is neither said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the individual man or the individual horse. The species in which the things primarily called substance are, are called <span><em>secondary substances</em></span>, as also are the genera of these species. For example, the individual man belongs in a species, man, and animal is a genus of the species; so these – both man and animal – are called secondary substances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For if one is to say of the individual man what he is, it will be in place to give the species or the genus (though more informative to give man than animal); but to give any of the other things would be out of place – for example, to say ‘white’ or ‘runs’ or anything like that. So it is reasonable that these should be the only things called substances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now of actual things some are universal, others particular (I call universal that which is by its nature predicated of a number of things, and particular that which is not; man, for instance, is a universal, Callias a particular.) So it must sometimes be of a universal that one states that something holds or does not, sometimes of a particular. Now if one states universally of a universal that something holds or does not, there will be contrary statements (examples of what I mean by ‘stating universally of a universal’ are ‘every man is white’ and ‘no man is white’). But when one states something of a universal but not universally, the statements are not contrary (though what is being revealed may be contrary). Examples of what I mean by ‘stating of a universal not universally’ are ‘a man is white’ and ‘a man is not white’; man is a universal but it is not used universally in the statement (for ‘every’ does not signify the universal but that it is taken universally). It is not true to predicate a universal universally of a subject, for there cannot be an affirmation in which a universal is predicated universally of a subject, for instance ‘every man is every animal’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arguments such as the following depend upon ambiguity. ‘Those learn who know: for it is those who know their letters who learn the letters dictated to them’. For to ‘learn’ is ambiguous; it signifies both ‘to understand’ by the use of knowledge, and also ‘to acquire knowledge’.</p>

<p>IV, 166a <span class="citation" data-cites="pickard-cambridge">(<a href="#ref-pickard-cambridge" role="doc-biblioref">Pickard-Cambridge 1928</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples such as the following depend upon amphiboly: ‘I wish that you the enemy may capture’. Also the thesis, ‘There must be knowledge of what one knows’: for it is possible by this phrase to mean that knowledge belongs to both the knower and the known. Also, ‘There must be sight of what one sees: one sees the pillar: <span><em>ergo</em></span> the pillar has sight’. Also, ‘What you profess to-be, that you profess to-be: you profess a stone to-be: <span><em>ergo</em></span> you profess-to-be a stone’. Also, ‘Speaking of the silent is possible’: for ‘speaking of the silent’ also has a double meaning: it may mean that the speaker is silent or that the things of which he speaks are so.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are three varieties of these ambiguities and amphibolies: (1) When either the expression or the name has strictly more than one meaning, e.g. &gt;aet’os and the ‘dog’; (2) when by custom we use them so; (3) when words that have a simple sense taken alone have more than one meaning in combination; e.g. ‘knowing letters’. For each word, both ‘knowing’ and ‘letters’, possibly has a single meaning: but both together have more than one–either that the letters themselves have knowledge or that someone else has it of them.</p>

<p>Secundum amphiboliam autem tales: velle accipere me pugnantes, et ‘putas quod quis scit hoc scit?’ Nam et scientem et scitum contingit ut scientem significari hac oratione. Et ‘putas quod videt quis, hoc videt? Videt autem columnam, quare videt columna’. Et ‘putas quod tu dicis esse, hoc tu dicis esse? Dicis autem lapidem esse; tu ergo dicis lapis esse’. Et ‘putas est tacentem dicere?’ Duplex enim est tacentem dicere, et hunc dicentem tacere et quare dicuntur. Sunt autem tres modi secundum aequivocationem et amphiboliam: unus quidem quando vel oratio vel nomen principaliter significat plura, ut piscis et canis; alius autem quando soliti sumus sic dicere; tertius vero quando compositum plura significat, separatum vero simpliciter, ut ‘scit saeculum’; nam utrumque, si contingit, unum quid significat, et scire et saeculum; ambo autem plura, aut saeculum ipsum scientiam habere aut saeculi alium.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon the combination of words there depend instances such as the following: ‘A man can walk while sitting, and can write while not writing’. For the meaning is not the same if one divides the words and if one combines them in saying that ‘it is possible to walk-while-sitting’ [and write while not writing]. The same applies to the latter phrase, too, if one combines the words ‘to write-while-not-writing’: for then it means that he has the power to write and not to write at once; whereas if one does not combine them, it means that when he is not writing he has the power to write.</p>

<p>Upon division depend the propositions that 5 is 2 and 3, and odd, and that the greater is equal: for it is that amount and more besides.

<p>Fallacies, then, that depend on Accident occur whenever any attribute is claimed to belong in like manner to a thing and to its accident. For since the same thing has many accidents there is no necessity that all the same attributes should belong to all of a thing’s predicates and to their subject as well. Thus (e.g.), ‘If Coriscus be different from “man”, he is different from himself: for he is a man’: or ‘If he be different from Socrates, and Socrates be a man, then’, they say, ‘he has admitted that Coriscus is different from a man, because it so happens (<span><em>accidit</em></span>) that the person from whom he said that he (Coriscus) is different is a man’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those that depend on whether an expression is used absolutely or in a certain respect and not strictly, occur whenever an expression used in a particular sense is taken as though it were used absolutely, e.g. in the argument ‘If what is not is the object of an opinion, then what is not is’: for it is not the same thing ‘to be <span class="math inline">x</span>’ and ‘to be’’ absolutely. Or again, ‘What is, is not, if it is not a particular kind of being, e.g. if it is not a man.’ For it is not the same thing ‘not to be <span class="math inline">x</span>’ and ‘not to be’ at all: it looks as if it were, because of the closeness of the expression, i.e. because ‘to be <span class="math inline">x</span>’ is but little different from ‘to be’, and ‘not to be <span class="math inline">x</span>’ from ‘not to be’. Likewise also with any argument that turns upon the point whether an expression is used in a certain respect or used absolutely. Thus e.g. ‘Suppose an Indian to be black all over, but white in respect of his teeth; then he is both white and not white.’ Or if both characters belong in a particular respect, then, they say, ‘contrary attributes belong at the same time’. This kind of thing is in some cases easily seen by any one, e.g. suppose a man were to secure the statement that the Ethiopian is black, and were then to ask whether he is white in respect of his teeth; and then, if he be white in that respect, were to suppose at the conclusion of his questions that therefore he had proved dialectically that he was both white and not white. But in some cases it often passes undetected, viz. in all cases where, whenever a statement is made of something in a certain respect, it would be generally thought that the absolute statement follows as well; and also in all cases where it is not easy to see which of the attributes ought to be rendered strictly. A situation of this kind arises, where both the opposite attributes belong alike: for then there is general support for the view that one must agree absolutely to the assertion of both, or of neither: e.g. if a thing is half white and half black, is it white or black?</p>

<p>If a text is regarded as ambiguous, because it can be interpreted in two or more meanings, the treatment is as follows: first we must examine whether it is indeed ambiguous; then we must show how it would have been written if the writer had wished it to have the meaning which our adversaries give to it; next, that our interpretation is practicable, and practicable in conformity with the Honourable and the Right, with Statute Law, Legal Custom, the Law of Nature, or Equity; of our adversaries’ interpretation the opposite is true; and the text is not ambiguous since one well understands which is the true sense. There are some who think that for the development of this kind of cause a knowledge of amphibolies as taught by the dialecticians is highly useful. I, however, believe that this knowledge is of no help at all, and is, I may even say, a most serious hindrance. In fact these writers are on the lookout for all amphibolies, even for such as yield no sense at all in one of the two interpretations. Accordingly, when some one else speaks, they are his annoying hecklers, and when he writes, they are his boring and also misty interpreters. And when they themselves speak, wishing to do so cautiously and deftly, they prove to be utterly inarticulate. Thus, in their fear to utter some ambiguity while speaking, they cannot even pronounce their own names.</p>

<p>Further, some definitions consist of partitions, others of divisions; of partitions when the subject at issue is, as it were, dismembered into its parts, e.g. if one were to say the civil law was that which consists of laws, decrees of the senate, previous decisions, the authority of the jurisconsults, the edicts of the magistrates, custom, and equity. A definition based on division, on the other hand, comprises all species which are subordinate to the species which is being defined, in the following way: A legal transfer of property is either transfer with legal obligation or cession at law, of things which can be bought, between parties who can do this in accordance with the civil law.</p>

<p>What is called an “amphiboly” by the dialecticians makes the expression obscure because of the confusion between an undivided and divided word, as in the phrase “Let an <span><em>aulêtris</em></span> (“flute-girl”) that has fallen be ‘public’.” It means one thing when the word <span><em>aulêtris</em></span> is taken as a whole and undivided, another when divided: “Let an <span><em>aulê tris</em></span> (“a hall thrice”) fallen be public property.” Furthermore, (the expression is ambiguous) when it is unclear what some part of a word belongs to; for example, Heracles fights <span><em>oukentaurois</em></span>. This has two meanings, that Heracles does not at all (<span><em>oukhi</em></span>) fight with centaurs or that he fights not among (<span><em>ouk en</em></span>) bulls.

And again (<span><em>Iliad</em></span> 2.547–48), “The people of great Erechtheus, whom once Athene / Nurtured, Zeus’ daughter, and the grain-giving land bore.” It is unclear whether he is saying the people or Erechtheus were nurtured by Athene and born from the land.</p>

<p>There are the following subtypes of the noun (these also are referred to as ‘species’): proper, appellative, attached, relative, quasi-relative, homonymous, synonymous, dionymous, eponymous, ethnic, interrogative, indefinite, anaphoric (also referred to by the names ‘similative’, ‘demonstrative’, and ‘correlative’), collective, distributive, inclusive, onomatopoeic, generic, specific, ordinal, absolute, participatory.</p>
<p>1. A proper noun signifies substance that is individual, such as ‘Homer, Socrates’.</p>
<p>2. An appellative noun signifies substance that is shared, such as ‘man, horse’.</p>
<p>3. An attached noun is placed next to proper or appellative nouns alike, and conveys praise or blame. It is understood in three ways – as referring to the soul, to the body, or to externals; to the soul as in ‘temperate, licentious’; to the body as in ‘fast, slow’; to externals as in ‘rich, poor’.</p>

<p>5. A quasi-relative noun is exemplified by ‘night, day, death, life’.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>12. An interrogative noun, also called ‘questioning’, is so called because it makes an enquiry, for example ‘who? what sort of? how much? how great?’</p>
<p>13. An indefinite noun is one which conveys an opposite sense to that of the interrogative, for instance ‘whoever, whatever sort, however much, however great’.</p>
<p>14. An anaphoric noun, also called ‘similative’, ‘demonstrative’, and ‘correlative’, is one which signifies a likeness; for instance ‘of such a kind, so much, so great’.</p>
<p>15. A collective noun is a noun in the singular number which signifies a plurality, such as ‘people, chorus, crowd’.</p>
<p>16. A distributive is a noun which, when two or more things are involved, refers to one of them, such as <span><em>hekateros</em></span> (each – of two), <span><em>hekastos</em></span> (each – of more than two). …</p>

<p>The third species of amphiboly arises from the fact that some phrase signifies several things while any one of its parts used by itself signifies only one, like ‘knows the age.’ Now this phrase is ambiguous: it signifies both that someone knows the age and that the age has knowledge of someone. And the reason for this is that the word ‘age’ can be the object of this verb ‘knows’ or its subject. This case is similar: ‘what someone sees, sees this,’ where the word ‘this’ can be the subject of the verb ‘sees’ in its second occurence or its object. This is also similar: ‘what someone knows, knows this,’ where the word ‘this’ can be the subject or object of the verb ‘knows’ in its second occurrence. Also this: ‘I would like me to take the enemy.’ This is ambiguous because the accusative ‘me’ can be the subject of the verb ‘take’ or its object, and the accusative ‘enemy’ can also be the subject or object of the same verb.</p>
