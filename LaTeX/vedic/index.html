<p class="ltx_p">Although the earliest texts, such as the hymns of the Ṛgveda,
were composed in verse, the liturgical works (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">brāhmaṇa</span>) of the
middle vedic period were composed in prose. This practice was
continued in the literature of the expert traditions; most ancient
works falling within the Vedic Supplements are in prose. Probably
because instruction in the expert traditions was carried out
orally and the pedagogy of these schools was based on first
memorizing the basic texts and then delving into their meaning
with the aid of the teacher, the basic texts came to be composed
in an aphoristic style known as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtra</span>.
A <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtra</span> is a sentence
from which most non-essential elements have been removed.
Individual <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtras</span> are often syntactically connected to the
preceding, words of earlier <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtras</span> being implicit in later ones, a
convention technically called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">anuvṛtti</span>. This convention makes
the entire composition similar to a chain and each <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtra</span> a link
in that chain. It is this characteristic that probably gave it the
name <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtra</span> (lit., ‘thread’), the composition being compared to
a thread on which each aphorism is strung like a pearl. Given
the brevity of each <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtra</span>, it is frequently impossible to understand
the meaning without the benefit of either an oral explanation
or a commentary.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The Dharmasūtra forms part of the voluminous Kalpasūtra of
Āpastamba containing thirty <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">praśnas</span> (lit., ‘questions’) or books.
The first twenty-four comprise the Śrautasūtra. Books 25–6
contain the Mantrapāṭha or the collections of ritual formulas to
be used in domestic rites, and book 27 contains the Gṛhyasūtra.
The two books of our Dharmasūtra occupy books 28–9, and
the final book contains the Śulvasūtra, a treatise on principles of
geometry needed for the vedic sacrifice. Āpastamba belongs to
the Taittirīya branch of the Black Yajurveda. Opinion is divided
as to whether the entire Kalpasūtra was composed by a single
individual (Kane 1962–75, i. 54). The Kalpasūtra of Āpastamba
has been preserved better than most probably because commentaries
were written on it at a relatively early date.</p>

Āpastamba’s, however, the ritual texts of Baudhāyana have been
tampered with repeatedly and contain numerous additions and
interpolations. The extent and structure of the entire Kalpasūtra
are not altogether clear. It appears that the first twenty-nine
books contain the Śrautasūtra and other ritual treatises; book
30 contains the Śulvasūtra (vedic geometry); and the next four
books comprise the Gṛhyasútra. The last four books are the
Dharmasūtra.</p>

these sutras to Baudhāyana. While preparing his critical edition of the
Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra (BaudhŚS), W. Caland examined all available
manuscripts of the above-mentioned types of the Sūtra-texts ascribed to
Baudhāyana, and formulated the order of the Baudhāyana corpus. In the
printed edition of the Śrautasūtra the Śulbasūtra forms the Praśna XXX.

and of Kātyāyana,
in which the Śulbasūtra

The last of these belongs to the Śuklayajurveda (the
Vājasaneyisaṃhitā), the first five to the Kṛṣṇayajurveda (Baudhāyana,
Āpastamba, and Vādhula to the Taittirīyasaṃhitā, and Mānava and Varāha
to the Maitrāyaṇīyasaṃhitā).

<br class="ltx_break">
Precise dating of any of these texts is impossible. The earliest, that of
Baudhāyana, was perhaps written before 500 B.C., and the remainder presumably
antedate the Christian era. It was, indeed, during this period also, probably
in the second century B.C., that the most striking <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">śyenaciti</span> of which
remains survive was built in Kauśāmbī.
The Āpastamba appears to be the
second oldest of the major Śulbasūtras, and the Kātyāyana, which consists of
a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtra</span> section (to a large extent repeating <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sūtras</span> of the Āpastamba verbatim),
followed by a verse section, is among the latest; the Mānava has apparently
copied some verses from the Kātyāyana.

<br class="ltx_break">
Each of the basic altars must be constructed with five layers of bricks, and
there must be a fixed number of bricks in each layer; moreover, the bricks in
the second and fourth layers must not be directly above or below those in the
first, third, and fifth layers. And the surface covered by the altar, regardless
of its shape, must cover an area of seven and one half square <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">puruṣas</span> or, for
certain purposes, that area increased by specified numbers of square <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">puruṣas</span>,
or it must be multiplied by a given factor. Finally, the altar must be correctly
oriented with respect to the cardinal directions. The task faced by the authors
of the Śulbasūtras was to prescribe rules for laying out these altars with only
a rope (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">rajju</span> or <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">śulba</span>) of determined length and posts or gnomons (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">śaṅku</span>).
The geometrical problems that were solved by these altar-builders are indeed
impressive, but it would be a mistake to see in their works the unique origin of
geometry;
others in India and elsewhere, whether in response to practical or
theoretical problems, may well have advanced as far without their solutions
having been committed to memory or eventually transcribed in manuscripts.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The expression “Veda” is justified only for this literature
which is regarded as revealed. However, there is another
class of works, which has the closest connection with the
Vedic literature, but yet cannot be said to belong to the
Veda. These are the so-called Kalpasūtras (sometimes also
called briefly “Sūtras”) or manuals on ritual, which are
composed in a peculiar, aphoristic prose style. These
include:

<br class="ltx_break">
1. The S̆rautasūtras, which contain the rules for the
performance of the great sacrifices, which often lasted many
days, at which many sacred fires had to burn and a great
number of priests had to be employed.

<br class="ltx_break">
2. The Gṛhyasūtras, which contain directions for the
simple ceremonies and sacrificial acts of daily life (at birth,
marriage, death, and so on).

<br class="ltx_break">
3. The Dharmasūtras, books of instruction on spiritual
and secular law–the oldest law-books of the Indians.

<br class="ltx_break">
Like Brahmaṇas, Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads, these works,
too, are connected with one of the four Vedas ; and there
are S̆rauta, Gṛhya, and Dharmasūtras which belong to the
Ṛgveda, others which belong to the Sāmaveda, to the
Yajurveda, or the Atharvaveda. As a matter of fact, they
originated in certain Vedic schools which set themselves the
task of the study of a certain Veda. Yet all these books of
instruction are regarded as human work, and no longer as
divine revelation ; they do not belong to the Veda, but to
the “Vedāṅgas,” the “limbs,” i.e. “the auxiliary sciences
of the Veda.”</p>

the elaborate geometry and rules of orientation used in the construction of these altars. This
Śulvasūtra tradition probably goes back to the Indus people, who lived for a millenium in
brick-built cities and needed solar time-reckoning, as did other agriculturally based riverine

<p class="ltx_p">The Baudhāyana-Śulvasūtra (1,22–28) describes a method to construct an oriented
square and thus to define the cardinal and intermediate directions by using a gnomon and
a cord with marked midpoint. This produces a pattern of “intersecting circles,” which is an
important motif on Early and Mature Harappan painted pottery, and also a favorite motif
on Harappan bathroom floors and “bath tubs.” I suspect this motif relates to the necessity
of leveling the ground for the gnomon by means of water. In later Indian astronomical texts
water is recommended for making ground perfectly level.</p>
