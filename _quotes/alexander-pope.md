#### Alexander Pope, *An Essay on Criticism*, second edition, Part 2, lines 256-269:[^1]

> Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see,  
> &nbsp; Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.  
> In ev'ry Work regard the Writer's End,  
> &nbsp; Since none can compass more than they Intend;  
> &nbsp; And if the Means be just, the Conduct true,  
> &nbsp; Applause, in spite of trivial Faults, is due.  
> As Men of Breeding, oft the Men of Wit  
> &nbsp; T' avoid great Errors, must the less commit,  
> &nbsp; Neglect the Rules each Verbal Critick lays,  
> &nbsp; For not to know some Trifles, is a Praise.  
> Most Criticks fond of some subservient Art,  
> &nbsp; Still make the Whole depend upon a Part,  
> &nbsp; They talk of Principles, but Parts they prize,  
> &nbsp; And All to one lov'd Folly Sacrifice.
