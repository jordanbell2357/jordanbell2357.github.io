p. 44, Chapter 5:

> Further, as for what looks to the firmness and constancy of mathematical science, which does not change from time to time, nor depart from its own essential nature, nor is conceived fi rst in one way and then in another, this too is embraced by the common subject- matter of mathematical science within its reasoning. But one should not think of these common features as supervening on, but as being prior to, the particular studies; nor should they be thought of as included in the particular and having their being with them, but as having already a being which is prior to them and more fundamental, and not as dwelling in them but as set in place before the special objects of each mathematical science. For this reason knowledge of them is common to all and fundamental, more basic than that of the particular ones, and giving a general overview of all, arranging together all theorems of mathematics from a single beginning to a single end, surveying their kinship and likeness to each other, while taking account also of what is dissimilar and diff erent in them, collecting together their primary kinds and their species, and distinguishing them. Also it surveys their common agreements, their prime hypotheses, their defi nitions, their postulates, their divisions and compositions, their aggregations and separations, their excesses and defi ciencies and comparisons, throughout all the kinds of mathematical entities. It gives a unifi ed account and not one separately of each, distinguishing what is possible in them and what impossible, what necessary and what not, the true and the false, and also their diff erences, their number and character, conducting a most accurate investigation.
