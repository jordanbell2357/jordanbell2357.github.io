> 1\. From my grandfather Verus, nobility of character and evenness of temper.
>
> 2\. From the reputation of my father and what I remember of him, modesty and manliness.
>
> 3\. From my mother, piety and generosity, and to abstain not only from doing wrong but even from contemplating such an act; and the simplicity, too, of her way of life, far removed from that of the rich.
>
> 4\. From my great-grandfather, that I never had to attend the public schools, but benefited from good teachers at home, and to have come to realize that this is a matter on which one should spare no expense.[^2]

    > *Παρὰ τοῦ προπάππου τὸ μὴ εἰς δημοσίας διατριβὰς φοιτῆσαι καὶ τὸ ἀγαθοῖς διδασκάλοις κατ̓ οἶκον χρήσασθαι καὶ τὸ γνῶναι ὅτι εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα δεῖ ἐκτενῶς ἀναλίσκειν.*

Explanatory Notes, p. 144: 

> This book, alone in the work, is systematically arranged, as a record of debts to other people (and to the gods, 1.17), which have helped to take forward the ethical development or journey that is the main theme of Med. (see Introduction, p. xv). With each comment (‘From . . .’), we need to supply the idea, ‘I have learned to value the following quality’ or ‘I have received the following benefit’.
