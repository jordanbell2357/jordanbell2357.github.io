My tutoring practice is done online in one hour sessions, scheduled with Google Calendar and using the client's preference of video chat. The one-on-one communication in tutoring avoid all the downfalls of online courses (disengagement, undirected, uncertain if you are doing it right), and adds new tools to use for one-on-one teaching. Most of math is done on paper, and my experience has shown that the simple method of holding paper up to the camera works perfectly.

This academic year is the first year that I am giving my tutoring practice the anchor of a website, with information about my experience, credentials, methods and my own created material.

First, I bring complete familiarity with the Ontario secondary mathematics curriculum, and at the university level with all first to third year mathematics courses at the University of Toronto (as a late dropout from the PhD program at the University of Toronto, I have taught and been teaching assistant for most courses multiple times). In addition to long experience tutoring students at all three of the University of Toronto campuses, I have tutored university mathematics and economics courses for students at the University of Western Ontario and McGill University over online sessions.

Second, my major value added is skill with designing study plans for courses, choosing specifically targetted extra exercise sets to strengthen areas, and guiding the client to where to focus their efforts to see the greatest gains, much like a personal trainer at a gym vs. hesitantly doing reps on a machine you are not sure if you are using correctly after a group class you didn't quite follow.

My rate per one hour session is \$55 (CAD) per one hour session. I send an invoice the same day from [Xero](https://www.xero.com/ca/) to be paid the same day after the session by Interac E-Transfer to my email address jordan.bell@gmail.com; I have not so far needed to set up methods to ensure payment, and I believe that the service I offer is good enough that clients want further sessions and not to dine and dash, and invoicing after the session gives potential clients who have just found my practice certainty not having to pay before delivery of service.
