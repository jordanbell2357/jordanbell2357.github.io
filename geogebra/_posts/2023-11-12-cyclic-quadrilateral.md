To deduce all the angles in the given figure, we will apply various geometric properties step by step. The figure presents a circle with a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed within it, a central angle BOC given as 110°, and the line OC which is parallel to BD.

**Properties of a Cyclic Quadrilateral**
In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of a pair of opposite angles is 180°. Since angle BAC is 55°, its opposite angle BDC must be 180° - 55° = 125°.

**Angles Formed by Parallel Lines and a Transversal**
Line OC is parallel to line BD, and line AC is a transversal. According to the alternate interior angles theorem, angle ACD must be equal to angle BAC, which is 55°.

**Isosceles Triangle Properties**
OC is a radius of the circle, and since O is the center of the circle, OC and OB are radii and thus equal in length. Therefore, triangle OBC is isosceles with OB = OC. Since the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, angle OBC is equal to angle OCB. Since angle BOC is 110°, angles OBC and OCB are each (180° - 110°) / 2 = 35°.

**Triangle Sum Theorem**
The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. In triangle OBC, we have two angles of 35° each, so angle BOC must be 180° - 35° - 35° = 110°, which confirms our given value.

**Properties of Triangles on the Same Base and Between the Same Parallels**
Triangles ABC and ADC are on the same base AC and between the same parallels AC and BD. The angles at C for both triangles should be equal due to the alternate interior angles theorem (since AC is a transversal of parallel lines OC and BD). We've already established that angle ACD is 55°, hence angle ACB must also be 55°.

**Finding Remaining Angles**
Now that we know angles ACD and ACB are each 55°, we can find angle ABC. Angle ABC is supplementary to angle ACB because they form a straight line together. So, angle ABC = 180° - 55° = 125°.

**Using Properties of a Cyclic Quadrilateral Again**
Using the property that the sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral equals 180°, we can confirm the angles at B and D:

- Since angle ACD is 55°, angle ABD must be 180° - 55° = 125°.
- Since angle ACB is 55°, angle ADB must also be 180° - 55° = 125°.

**Sum of Angles in Quadrilateral**
The sum of angles in any quadrilateral is 360°. We can use this to check our work:

- Sum of angles A + B + C + D = 55° + 125° + 125° + 55° = 360°.

**Revisiting Triangle OBD**
Triangle OBD is also an isosceles triangle because OB and OD are radii of the circle and therefore equal. Angles OBD and ODB are equal:

- Since angle BOD is the exterior angle for triangle BOC, and we know angle BOC is 35°, angle BOD must be 2 * 35° = 70° due to the exterior angle theorem.
- Therefore, angles OBD and ODB are each (180° - 70°) / 2 = 55°.
