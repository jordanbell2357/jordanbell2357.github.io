#### [Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations with selected correspondence*, Translated by Robin Hard and Introduction and Notes by Christopher Gill, Oxford World's Classics, Oxford University Press, 2011](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/meditations-9780199573202?cc=ca&lang=en&)

##### Book 1[^1], p. 3 

> 1. From my grandfather Verus, nobility of character and evenness of temper.
> 2. From the reputation of my father and what I remember of him, modesty and manliness.
> 3. From my mother, piety and generosity, and to abstain not only from doing wrong but even from contemplating such an act; and the simplicity, too, of her way of life, far removed from that of the rich.
> 4. From my great-grandfather, that I never had to attend the public schools, but benefited from good teachers at home, and to have come to realize that this is a matter on which one should spare no expense.

[^1]: Introduction, p. ix: "But only the first book (which records Marcusâ€™ ethical debts to those who have influenced him) has any clear overall structure, and it was presumably composed in that way by Marcus."

##### p. 9

> For all these things require the help of the gods and of fortune.
