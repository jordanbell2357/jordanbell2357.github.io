> This craft is something newly created. It is needed for business calculations. Scholars have written many works on it. They are used in the cities for the instruction of children. The best method of instruction is to begin with calculation, because it is concerned with lucid knowledge and systematic proofs. As a rule, it produces an enlightened intellect that is trained along correct lines. It has been said that whoever applies himself to the study of calculation early in his life will as a rule be truthful, because calculation has a sound basis and requires self-discipline. (Soundness and self-discipline) will thus become character qualities of such a person. He will get accustomed to truthfulness and adhere to it methodically.

> The Greek work on this craft which has been translated into Arabic is the book of Euclid. It is entitled *Kitâb al-uṣûl wa-l-arkân*, ‘Book of Basic Principles and Pillars’. It is the simplest book on the subject for students. It was the first Greek work to be translated in Islam in the days of Abû Ja‘far al-Manṣûr. The existing recensions differ, depending on the respective translators, (of whom there are at least three).
>
> The work contains fifteen books, four on the planes, one on proportions, another one on the relationship of planes to each other, three on numbers, the tenth on rational and irrational (quantities) —the ‘roots’—and five on solids.
>
> Many abridgments of Euclid’s work have been written. Avicenna, for instance, devoted a special monograph treatment to it. Many scholars have also written commentaries on it. It is the starting point of the geometrical sciences in general.
>
> Geometry enlightens the intellect and sets one’s mind right. All its proofs are very clear and orderly. It is hardly possible for errors to enter into geometrical reasoning, because it is well arranged and orderly. Thus, the mind that constantly applies itself to geometry is not likely to fall into error. In this convenient way, the person who knows geometry acquires intelligence. It has been assumed that the following statement was written upon Plato’s door: ‘No one who is not a geometrician may enter our house.’
>
> Our teachers used to say that one’s application to geometry does to the mind what soap does to a garment. It washes off stains and cleanses it of grease and dirt. The reason for this is that geometry is well arranged and orderly, as we have mentioned.
