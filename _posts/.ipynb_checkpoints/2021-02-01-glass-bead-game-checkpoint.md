> But although T. unfortunately is not fitted for higher posts, he is 
> nevertheless a jewel in the Vicus Lusorum, an altogether irreplaceable treasure. He has mastered 
> the technique of our game like a great musician his instrument; he instinctively finds the most 
> delicate nuances, and is also an exceptional instructor. In the advanced and highest review 
> courses — for my part he would be wasted in the lower ones — I could scarcely manage without

> ... The way he analyzes the specimen Games of boys without ever discouraging 
> them, the way he detects their tricks, infallibly recognizes and exposes everything imitative or 
> purely decorative, the way he finds the sources of error in a Game that has started well but then 
> gone astray, and lays these errors bare like flawlessly prepared anatomical specimens — is 
> altogether unique. It is this sharp and incorruptible talent for analysis and correction that assures 
> him the respect of students and colleagues, which otherwise might have been jeopardized by his 
> unstable demeanor and shyness.
