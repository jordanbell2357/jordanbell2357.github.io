##### Introduction, p. viii-ix

> Ancient Greek and Roman texts are conventionally subdivided into ‘books’ and ‘chapters’; and this arrangement has been applied to this work. But only the first book (which records Marcus’ ethical debts to those who have influenced him) has any clear overall structure, and it was presumably composed in that way by Marcus. The other books show little or no sign of deliberate organization. It seems likely that Marcus simply wrote down one or two comments at moments of leisure, for instance, at the beginning or end of the day, and the resulting work is the sum of those comments. The Meditations are written in Greek, which was the standard language for ancient philosophy and which Marcus would have known well (though, of course, his normal language was Latin).

> 4. From my great-grandfather, that I never had to attend the public schools, but benefited from good teachers at home, and to have come to realize that this is a matter on which one should spare no expense.

> 17. ...
>    For all these things require the help of the gods and of fortune.
