##### Book of Changes, ䷀乾, 20 文言

##### [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&id=81907)

> The superior man learns and accumulates the results of his learning; puts questions, and discriminates among those results; dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he has attained to; and carries it into practice with benevolence. What the Yi says, 'The dragon appears in the field:--it will be advantageous to meet with the great man,' has reference to the virtuous qualities of a ruler (as thus described).

> *君子學以聚之，問以辯之，寬以居之，仁以行之。《易》曰「見龍在田、利見大人」，君德也。*

##### *The Sacred Books of China. The Texts of Confucianism. Part II. The Yî King*, translated by James Legge, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume XVI, Clarendon Press, 1882. Appendix IV. Section I. Chapter VI. 31.
