#### Alexander Pope, *An Essay on Criticism*, Part 2, ll. 253-266

> 253 &emsp; Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,  
> 254 Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.  
> 255 In ev'ry work regard the writer's end,  
> 256 Since none can compass more than they intend;  
> 257 And if the means be just, the conduct true,  
> 258 Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due.  
> 259 As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,  
> 260 T' avoid great errors, must the less commit:  
> 261 Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays,  
> 262 For not to know such trifles, is a praise.  
> 263 Most critics, fond of some subservient art,  
> 264 Still make the whole depend upon a part:  
> 265 They talk of principles, but notions prize,  
> 266 And all to one lov'd folly sacrifice.[^1]
