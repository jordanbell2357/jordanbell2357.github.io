> HandBrake is a open-source tool, built by volunteers, for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.

By clicking on the prompts that appear using the HandBrake installer, I automatically downloaded
```windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.12-win-x64.exe```.
After installing that, without needing to restart, I was able successfully to use HandBrake to
convert a ```.webm``` file to a ```.mp4``` file.
