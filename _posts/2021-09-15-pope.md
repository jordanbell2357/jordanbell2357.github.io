> 255 Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,  
> 256 Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.  
> 257 In ev'ry work regard the writer's End,  
> 258 Since none can compass more than they intend;  
> 259 And if the means be just, the conduct true,  
> 260 Applause, in spight of trivial faults, is due.
