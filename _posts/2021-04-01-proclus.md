> All those who have written histories bring to this point their
> account of the development of this science. Not long after
> these men came Euclid, who brought together the Elements,
> systematizing many of the theorems of Eudoxus, perfecting
> many of those of Theaetetus, and putting in irrefutable
> demonstrable form propositions that had been rather loosely
> established by his predecessors. He lived in the time of
> Ptolemy the First, for Archimedes, who lived after the time of
> the first Ptolemy, mentions Euclid. **It is also reported that
> Ptolemy once asked Euclid if there was not a shorter road to
> geometry than through the *Elements*, and Euclid replied that
> there was no royal road to geometry.**[^1] He was therefore later
> than Plato’s group but earlier than Eratosthenes and Archimedes, for these two men were contemporaries, as Eratosthenes somewhere says. Euclid belonged to the persuasion of
> Plato and was at home in this philosophy; and this is why he
> thought the goal of the Elements as a whole to be the construction of the so-called Platonic figures.

    > **For Archimedes as a side note recalls a conversation Euclid once had with Ptolemy [Egyptian king], who asked him if there's a shortcut to learning geometry, a way to avoid immersing oneslf in the basics. Euclid answered, "There is no royal road to geometry."**
    
    Greek text of this passage from the Friedlein critical edition [Friedlein, G. (ed.), *Procli Diadochi in primum Euclidis elementorum librum commentarii*, Bibliotheca scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana, Teubner, 1873](https://mdz-nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:12-bsb11156410-9):

    > *καὶ γὰρ ὁ Ἀρχιμήδης ἐπιβαλὼν καὶ τῷ πρώτῳ μνημονεύει τοῦ Εὐκλείδου, καὶ μέντοι καί φασιν ὅτι Πτολεμαῖος ἤρετό ποτε αὐτόν, εἴ τίς ἐστιν περὶ γεωμετρίαν ὁδὸς συντομωτέρα τῆς στοιχειώσεως· ὁ δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο, μὴ εἶναι βασιλικὴν ἀτραπὸν ἐπὶ γεωμετρίαν.*
