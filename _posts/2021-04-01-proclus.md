> All those who have written histories bring to this point their
> account of the development of this science. Not long after
> these men came Euclid, who brought together the Elements,
> systematizing many of the theorems of Eudoxus, perfecting
> many of those of Theaetetus, and putting in irrefutable
> demonstrable form propositions that had been rather loosely
> established by his predecessors. He lived in the time of
> Ptolemy the First, for Archimedes, who lived after the time of
> the first Ptolemy, mentions Euclid. It is also reported that
> Ptolemy once asked Euclid if there was not a shorter road to
> geometry than through the *Elements*, and Euclid replied that
> there was no royal road to geometry. He was therefore later
> than Platoâ€™s group but earlier than Eratosthenes4 and Archimedes, for these two men were contemporaries, as Eratosthenes somewhere says. Euclid belonged to the persuasion of
> Plato and was at home in this philosophy; and this is why he
> thought the goal of the Elements as a whole to be the construction of the so-called Platonic figures.
