title: Windows video conversion with HandBrake
---

[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) 

> HandBrake is a open-source tool, built by volunteers, for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.

By clicking on the prompts that appear using the HandBrake installer, I automatically downloaded
`windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.12-win-x64.exe`.

![.NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime (v6.0.12) - Windows x64 Installer](/assets/images/screenshots/dot-NET-6-0-runtime.png)

After installing that, without needing to restart, I was able successfully to use HandBrake to
convert a `.webm` file to an `.mp4` file.
